FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n    11→- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n    12→- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n    13→- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n    14→- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n    15→- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n    16→- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n    17→- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n    18→\n    19→### Database Logging Pattern\n    20→Use `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n    21→- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n    22→- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n    23→- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n    24→- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n    25→\n    26→### Configuration Pattern\n    27→All config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n    28→- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n    29→- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n    30→- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n    31→\n    32→---\n    33→\n    34→## 2026-01-31 -

FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n\n### Database Logging Pattern\nUse `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n\n### Configuration Pattern\nAll config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 -

Beads c3y.3, c3y.4, and c3y.17 had overlapping requirements - c3y.3 fully implemented the Alembic setup\n  - When beads share requirements, verify against specific checklist before implementing\n  - Always check progress.md for what was already implemented in related beads\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.18\n- Created ProjectRepository with full CRUD operations\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/repositories/project.py` - ProjectRepository class with all CRUD methods\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/repositories/__init__.py` - Export ProjectRepository\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `create()` - Create new project with name, client_id, status, phase_status\n  - `get_by_id()` - Fetch project by UUID\n  - `get_by_client_id()` - Fetch all projects for a client\n  - `get_by_status()` - Fetch projects by status\n  - `list_all()` - Paginated list of all projects\n  - `update()` - Update project fields\n  - `update_phase_status()` - Convenience method for updating individual phase statuses\n  - `delete()` - Delete project by ID\n  - `exists()` - Check if project exists\n  - `count()` / `count_by_status()` - Count projects\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - DEBUG level entry/exit logging with parameters (sanitized)\n  - Full stack trace on exceptions via `exc_info=True`\n  - Entity IDs (project_id) included in all logs\n  - State transitions (status and phase changes) logged at INFO level\n  - Timing logs for operations >1 second via `db_logger.slow_query()`\n  - Transaction failures logged via `db_logger.transaction_failure()`\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `session.flush()` + `session.refresh()` to get server-generated values (like UUID) after insert\n  - `select().scalar_one_or_none()` is the async-friendly way to get optional single result\n  - `result.rowcount` from delete gives affected row count for determining if delete was successful\n  - Phase status changes should be logged individually by comparing old vs new dict keys\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.19\n- Implemented ProjectService with validation logic\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/schemas/project.py` - Pydantic schemas for Project API validation\n  - `backend/app/services/project.py` - ProjectService with business logic and validation\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Export Project schemas\n  - `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Export ProjectService and exceptions\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `ProjectCreate`, `ProjectUpdate`, `PhaseStatusUpdate` schemas with field validation\n  - `ProjectResponse`, `ProjectListResponse` schemas for API responses\n  - Constants: `VALID_PROJECT_STATUSES`, `VALID_PHASE_STATUSES`, `VALID_PHASES`\n  - `ProjectService` class with all CRUD methods:\n    - `create_project()` - Create with validation\n    - `get_project()` / `get_project_or_none()` - Fetch by ID\n    - `get_projects_by_client()` / `get_projects_by_status()` - Filtered queries\n    - `list_projects()` - Paginated list with total count\n    - `update_project()` - Update with status transition validation\n    - `update_phase_status()` - Update single phase with transition validation\n    - `delete_project()` - Delete by ID\n    - `project_exists()` - Check existence\n  - Custom exceptions: `ProjectServiceError`, `ProjectNotFoundError`, `ProjectValidationError`, `InvalidPhaseTransitionError`\n  - Status transition rules: active → completed/on_hold/cancelled, on_hold → active/cancelled, completed/cancelled → archived\n  - Phase transition rules: pending → in_progress/skipped, in_progress → completed/blocked, blocked → in_progress/skipped\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - DEBUG level entry/exit logging with parameters (sanitized)\n  - Full stack trace on exceptions via `exc_info=True`\n  - Entity IDs (project_id) included in all service logs\n  - Validation failures logged with field names and rejected values at WARNING level\n  - State transitions (phase changes) logged at INFO level\n  - Timing logs for operations >1 second\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Service layer validates business rules (transitions) while schema layer validates data format\n  - Use `frozenset` for immutable constant sets (faster lookup, thread-safe)\n  - Pydantic `field_validator` with `@classmethod` decorator for custom validation\n  - Combine multiple conditions in single `if` for SIM102 linting rule\n  - Service methods should re-raise `ProjectServiceError` subclasses, catch and log other exceptions\n---\n\n","numLines":554,"startLine":1,"totalLines":554}}}

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### Backend Layered Architecture\nThe backend follows a strict layered architecture pattern:\n- `app/api/` - FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n\n### Database Logging Pattern\nUse `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n\n### Configuration Pattern\nAll config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.1\n- Completed backend project structure initialization\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - SQLAlchemy models layer\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Pydantic schemas layer\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - External service clients layer\n  - `backend/app/workers/__init__.py` - Background task processing layer\n  - `backend/Procfile` - Railway deployment start command\n- Files already existed (verified):\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Environment-based config\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Structured logging with all required DB logging\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Async SQLAlchemy with pool management\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - FastAPI app with health checks and SIGTERM handling\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - API router setup\n  - `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Services layer\n  - `backend/app/repositories/__init__.py` - Repositories layer\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The backend was partially initialized in a previous iteration\n  - All Railway deployment requirements were already in place (PORT binding, health endpoints, SIGTERM handling)\n  - All error logging requirements were already implemented in `app/core/logging.py`\n  - Use `python3 -m py_compile` for quick syntax verification without needing dependencies installed\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.2\n- Completed FastAPI application setup with CORS, exception handlers, and OpenAPI docs\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added request logging middleware, exception handlers, and rate limit logging\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `RequestLoggingMiddleware` - Logs all requests with method, path, request_id, timing, and status codes\n  - `sanitize_body()` - Redacts sensitive fields (password, token, secret, etc.) from request body logs\n  - Request body logging at DEBUG level for non-GET requests\n  - Structured error responses with format `{\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str}`\n  - Exception handlers for: validation errors (422), rate limits (429), and general exceptions (500)\n  - `log_rate_limit_hit()` helper function for rate limit logging at WARNING level\n  - X-Request-ID header added to all responses\n  - Log levels: 4xx at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR, success at INFO\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - CORS middleware\n  - OpenAPI docs (conditional on debug mode)\n  - /health endpoint returning `{\"status\": \"ok\"}`\n  - SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown\n  - PORT from environment variable\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `request.state.request_id` to pass request_id through the request lifecycle\n  - BaseHTTPMiddleware is the standard way to add request logging in FastAPI\n  - Exception handlers are registered with `@app.exception_handler()`\n  - Rate limit exception handler uses status code `429` directly, can be triggered by rate limiting libraries\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.3\n- Configured SQLAlchemy with async support and PostgreSQL connection\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Added SSL mode and connection timeout handling\n  -

All required database logging (connection errors, slow queries, transaction failures, pool exhaustion)\n  - DATABASE_URL conversion from `postgres://` to `postgresql+asyncpg://`\n  - Session management with `get_session()` dependency and `transaction()` context manager\n- **Learnings:**\n  - asyncpg uses `connect_args` dict for `timeout` and `command_timeout` (not SQLAlchemy-level params)\n  - Alembic async migrations require `async_engine_from_config` and `connection.run_sync()` pattern\n  - Railway Procfile supports chained commands with `&&` for running migrations before server start\n  - SSL mode is added via URL query param, check for existing `?` to use `&` separator\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.4\n- Verified Alembic database migrations already complete (implemented in c3y.3)\n- No files changed - all requirements already satisfied\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Database connection error logging with masked connection string ✓\n  - Slow query logging (>100ms) at WARNING level ✓\n  - Transaction failure logging with rollback context ✓\n  - Migration start/end logging with version info ✓\n  - Table/model name in database error logs ✓\n  -

The c3y.3 bead fully implemented Alembic setup including all c3y.4 requirements\n  - When beads share requirements, verify against specific checklist before implementing\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.5\n- Added Redis client with connection pooling and circuit breaker pattern\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Added Redis pool size, timeouts, and circuit breaker settings\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Added `RedisLogger` class with comprehensive logging\n  - `backend/app/core/redis.py` - Created new Redis client module (connection pooling, circuit breaker)\n  - `backend/app/core/__init__.py` - Exported Redis components\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added Redis initialization/shutdown and health check endpoint\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `CircuitBreaker` class with CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN states for fault tolerance\n  - `RedisManager` class with connection pooling via redis-py `ConnectionPool`\n  - SSL/TLS support via `rediss://` URL detection (Railway uses SSL)\n  - Connection retry logic with exponential backoff for cold starts\n  - Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable (all methods return None)\n  - Comprehensive logging: connection errors (masked URL), timeouts, circuit state changes\n  - Health check endpoint at `/health/redis` with circuit breaker state\n  - Convenience methods: get, set, delete, exists, expire, ttl, incr, decr, hash ops, list ops\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log all outbound API calls with endpoint, method, timing ✓\n  -

Connect via REDIS_URL environment variable ✓\n  - Handle Redis connection failures gracefully (cache is optional) ✓\n  - Use SSL/TLS for Redis connections in production ✓\n  - Implement connection retry logic for cold starts ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - redis-py's `ConnectionPool.from_url()` auto-detects SSL from `rediss://` scheme\n  - Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures: track failures → open circuit → wait recovery_timeout → half-open test → close on success\n  - Use `asyncio.Lock()` to protect circuit breaker state changes in async context\n  - Railway sets `REDIS_URL` with `rediss://` prefix for TLS connections\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.6\n- Created pytest configuration with fixtures for database and Redis mocking\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/tests/__init__.py` - Test package marker\n  - `backend/tests/conftest.py` - Pytest fixtures for testing\n  - `backend/tests/test_fixtures.py` - Sample tests verifying fixtures work\n- **What was implemented:**\n  -

pytest configuration in `pyproject.toml` with asyncio_mode=\"auto\"\n  - Dev dependencies including pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, aiosqlite\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `StaticPool` for SQLite to ensure same connection is reused in session scope\n  - aiosqlite requires `check_same_thread=False` in connect_args\n  - MockRedis must implement both bytes return values (like real Redis) and clear() for test isolation\n  - Use `ASGITransport` with httpx `AsyncClient` for async testing FastAPI\n  - Fixtures that mock global singletons must store/restore original state\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.7\n- Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline with lint, test, and type-check jobs\n- Files created:\n  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions CI workflow\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/pyproject.toml` - Added ruff and mypy to dev dependencies, configured both tools\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Added explicit type annotation for formatter variable\n  - `backend/app/core/redis.py` - Fixed type annotations for dict/list return types, added AsyncGenerator import\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` -

Log mock/stub invocations for debugging (DEBUG level) ✓\n  - Tests work with DATABASE_URL env var ✓\n  - Use test database, not production ✓\n  - CI mirrors Railway environment (Python 3.11, env vars) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - MyPy `ignore_missing_imports = true` doesn't prevent \"cannot subclass Any\" errors - use `disallow_subclassing_any = false` for specific modules\n  - Ruff's `--output-format=github` produces GitHub-compatible annotations for inline error display\n  - pydantic-settings and pythonjsonlogger need explicit module entries (not just `.*` patterns) in mypy overrides\n  - Use `ruff check --fix` for auto-fixable issues, then manually address remaining warnings\n  - CI jobs run in parallel by default - use `needs:` to create dependencies between jobs\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.8\n- Configured Railway deployment for staging environment\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/railway.toml` - Railway configuration with health check, nixpacks builder, and staging env vars\n  - `backend/app/deploy.py` - Deployment script with comprehensive logging (runs migrations, validates env, health checks)\n  -

Migration creates table with proper PostgreSQL types (UUID, JSONB, TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `UUID(as_uuid=False)` to store UUIDs as strings in SQLAlchemy, avoiding UUID object serialization issues\n  - JSONB `server_default` requires `text(\"'{}'::jsonb\")` syntax, not just `text(\"{}\")`\n  - `mapped_column` with `default=dict` provides Python-side default, `server_default` provides database-side\n  - Alembic migrations should use modern Python type annotations (`str | None` vs `Union[str, None]`)\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.10\n- Created CrawledPage model with normalized_url, category, labels JSONB fields\n- Files created:\n  -
