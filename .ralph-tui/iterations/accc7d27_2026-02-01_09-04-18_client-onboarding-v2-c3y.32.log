Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### Backend Layered Architecture\nThe backend follows a strict layered architecture pattern:\n- `app/api/` - FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n\n### Database Logging Pattern\nUse `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n\n### Configuration Pattern\nAll config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n\n### SQLite Test Fixtures Pattern\nTests use SQLite in-memory for speed. PostgreSQL types need adaptation:\n- `conftest.py` has `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function\n- UUID columns → String(36), JSONB columns → JSON\n- PostgreSQL-specific server_default values are cleared (gen_random_uuid, ::jsonb, now())\n- Use `StaticPool` with `check_same_thread=False` for SQLite async\n- Session-scoped engine, per-test session with rollback for isolation\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.1\n- Completed backend project structure initialization\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - SQLAlchemy models layer\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Pydantic schemas layer\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - External service clients layer\n  - `backend/app/workers/__init__.py` - Background task processing layer\n  - `backend/Procfile` -

`backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Services layer\n  - `backend/app/repositories/__init__.py` - Repositories layer\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The backend was partially initialized in a previous iteration\n  - All Railway deployment requirements were already in place (PORT binding, health endpoints, SIGTERM handling)\n  - All error logging requirements were already implemented in `app/core/logging.py`\n  - Use `python3 -m py_compile` for quick syntax verification without needing dependencies installed\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.2\n- Completed FastAPI application setup with CORS, exception handlers, and OpenAPI docs\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added request logging middleware, exception handlers, and rate limit logging\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `RequestLoggingMiddleware` - Logs all requests with method, path, request_id, timing, and status codes\n  - `sanitize_body()` - Redacts sensitive fields (password, token, secret, etc.) from request body logs\n  - Request body logging at DEBUG level for non-GET requests\n  - Structured error responses with format `{\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str}`\n  - Exception handlers for: validation errors (422), rate limits (429), and general exceptions (500)\n  - `log_rate_limit_hit()` helper function for rate limit logging at WARNING level\n  - X-Request-ID header added to all responses\n  - Log levels: 4xx at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR, success at INFO\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - CORS middleware\n  - OpenAPI docs (conditional on debug mode)\n  - /health endpoint returning `{\"status\": \"ok\"}`\n  - SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown\n  - PORT from environment variable\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `request.state.request_id` to pass request_id through the request lifecycle\n  - BaseHTTPMiddleware is the standard way to add request logging in FastAPI\n  - Exception handlers are registered with `@app.exception_handler()`\n  - Rate limit exception handler uses status code `429` directly, can be triggered by rate limiting libraries\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.3\n- Configured SQLAlchemy with async support and PostgreSQL connection\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Added SSL mode and connection timeout handling\n  -

All required database logging (connection errors, slow queries, transaction failures, pool exhaustion)\n  - DATABASE_URL conversion from `postgres://` to `postgresql+asyncpg://`\n  - Session management with `get_session()` dependency and `transaction()` context manager\n- **Learnings:**\n  - asyncpg uses `connect_args` dict for `timeout` and `command_timeout` (not SQLAlchemy-level params)\n  - Alembic async migrations require `async_engine_from_config` and `connection.run_sync()` pattern\n  - Railway Procfile supports chained commands with `&&` for running migrations before server start\n  - SSL mode is added via URL query param, check for existing `?` to use `&` separator\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.4\n- Verified Alembic database migrations already complete (implemented in c3y.3)\n- No files changed - all requirements already satisfied\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Database connection error logging with masked connection string ✓\n  -

Created new Redis client module (connection pooling, circuit breaker)\n  - `backend/app/core/__init__.py` - Exported Redis components\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added Redis initialization/shutdown and health check endpoint\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `CircuitBreaker` class with CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN states for fault tolerance\n  - `RedisManager` class with connection pooling via redis-py `ConnectionPool`\n  - SSL/TLS support via `rediss://` URL detection (Railway uses SSL)\n  - Connection retry logic with exponential backoff for cold starts\n  - Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable (all methods return None)\n  - Comprehensive logging: connection errors (masked URL), timeouts, circuit state changes\n  - Health check endpoint at `/health/redis` with circuit breaker state\n  - Convenience methods: get, set, delete, exists, expire, ttl, incr, decr, hash ops, list ops\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log all outbound API calls with endpoint, method, timing ✓\n  -

Connect via REDIS_URL environment variable ✓\n  - Handle Redis connection failures gracefully (cache is optional) ✓\n  - Use SSL/TLS for Redis connections in production ✓\n  - Implement connection retry logic for cold starts ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - redis-py's `ConnectionPool.from_url()` auto-detects SSL from `rediss://` scheme\n  - Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures: track failures → open circuit → wait recovery_timeout → half-open test → close on success\n  - Use `asyncio.Lock()` to protect circuit breaker state changes in async context\n  - Railway sets `REDIS_URL` with `rediss://` prefix for TLS connections\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.6\n- Created pytest configuration with fixtures for database and Redis mocking\n- Files created:\n  -

pytest configuration in `pyproject.toml` with asyncio_mode=\"auto\"\n  - Dev dependencies including pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, aiosqlite\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `StaticPool` for SQLite to ensure same connection is reused in session scope\n  - aiosqlite requires `check_same_thread=False` in connect_args\n  - MockRedis must implement both bytes return values (like real Redis) and clear() for test isolation\n  - Use `ASGITransport` with httpx `AsyncClient` for async testing FastAPI\n  - Fixtures that mock global singletons must store/restore original state\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.7\n- Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline with lint, test, and type-check jobs\n- Files created:\n  -

Log mock/stub invocations for debugging (DEBUG level) ✓\n  - Tests work with DATABASE_URL env var ✓\n  - Use test database, not production ✓\n  - CI mirrors Railway environment (Python 3.11, env vars) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - MyPy `ignore_missing_imports = true` doesn't prevent \"cannot subclass Any\" errors - use `disallow_subclassing_any = false` for specific modules\n  - Ruff's `--output-format=github` produces GitHub-compatible annotations for inline error display\n  - pydantic-settings and pythonjsonlogger need explicit module entries (not just `.*` patterns) in mypy overrides\n  - Use `ruff check --fix` for auto-fixable issues, then manually address remaining warnings\n  - CI jobs run in parallel by default - use `needs:` to create dependencies between jobs\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.8\n- Configured Railway deployment for staging environment\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/railway.toml` - Railway configuration with health check, nixpacks builder, and staging env vars\n  - `backend/app/deploy.py` - Deployment script with comprehensive logging (runs migrations, validates env, health checks)\n  -

Migration creates table with proper PostgreSQL types (UUID, JSONB, TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `UUID(as_uuid=False)` to store UUIDs as strings in SQLAlchemy, avoiding UUID object serialization issues\n  - JSONB `server_default` requires `text(\"'{}'::jsonb\")` syntax, not just `text(\"{}\")`\n  - `mapped_column` with `default=dict` provides Python-side default, `server_default` provides database-side\n  - Alembic migrations should use modern Python type annotations (`str | None` vs `Union[str, None]`)\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.10\n- Created CrawledPage model with normalized_url, category, labels JSONB fields\n- Files created:\n  -

Crawl job management\n    - `save_crawled_page()` / `get_crawled_pages()` - Page persistence\n    - `start_crawl()` / `run_crawl()` - Crawl execution with URLPriorityQueue and Crawl4AI\n  - Custom exceptions: `CrawlServiceError`, `CrawlValidationError`, `CrawlNotFoundError`, `CrawlPatternError`\n  - Comprehensive validation: UUID format, URL format, crawl status, pagination\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log method entry/exit at DEBUG level with parameters (sanitized) ✓\n  - Log all exceptions with full stack trace and context via `exc_info=True` ✓\n  - Include entity IDs (project_id, crawl_id, page_id) in all service logs ✓\n  - Log validation failures with field names and rejected values at WARNING level ✓\n  - Log state transitions (crawl status changes) at INFO level ✓\n  - Add timing logs for operations >1 second via `SLOW_OPERATION_THRESHOLD_MS` ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - PatternMatcher should check exclude patterns first, then include patterns\n  - Use `fnmatch` for flexible glob pattern matching on URL paths\n  - Service layer orchestrates URLPriorityQueue + Crawl4AIClient + database persistence\n  - Periodic progress updates during crawl loop (every 10 pages) provide visibility\n  - Content hash via SHA256 enables change detection for crawled pages\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.28\n- Implemented CrawlRepository for page storage with deduplication\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/repositories/crawl.py` - CrawlRepository class with all CRUD methods\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/repositories/__init__.py` - Export CrawlRepository\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `create()` - Create new crawled page with all fields\n  - `get_by_id()` - Fetch page by UUID\n  - `get_by_normalized_url()` - Fetch page by (project_id, normalized_url) for deduplication\n  - `upsert()` - Create or update page with automatic deduplication (key method)\n  - `get_by_project()` - Paginated list of pages for a project\n  - `get_by_category()` - Filter pages by category within a project\n  - `update()` - Update page fields with category transition logging\n  - `delete()` / `delete_by_project()` - Delete single page or all project pages\n  - `exists()` / `url_exists()` - Existence checks for deduplication\n  - `count()` / `count_by_category()` - Count pages\n  - `get_changed_pages()` - Get pages modified since a given time\n  - `get_urls_for_project()` - Get all normalized URLs as a set for batch deduplication\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - DEBUG level entry/exit logging with parameters (sanitized URLs to 200 chars) ✓\n  - Full stack trace on exceptions via `exc_info=True` ✓\n  - Entity IDs (project_id, page_id) included in all logs ✓\n  - State transitions (category changes, content changes) logged at INFO level ✓\n  - Timing logs for operations >1 second via `db_logger.slow_query()` ✓\n  - Transaction failures logged via `db_logger.transaction_failure()` ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Upsert pattern: check for existing record first, then update or create based on result\n  - Log content_hash changes at INFO level to track page content updates during re-crawls\n  - The (project_id, normalized_url) composite unique index enforces deduplication at DB level\n  - `get_urls_for_project()` returns a set for O(1) membership tests during batch operations\n  - Provide `get_changed_pages()` for incremental processing workflows (pages modified since timestamp)\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.29\n- Added fetch-only mode for re-crawling specific URLs without full crawl discovery\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/services/crawl.py` - Added `fetch_urls()`, `_fetch_url_with_retry()`, `_get_existing_page()`, `_categorize_error()` methods\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `fetch_urls()` - Re-crawl specific URLs without URLPriorityQueue discovery\n  - Retry logic with exponential backoff (configurable max_retries and base_delay)\n  - Cache hit/miss logging at DEBUG level (page exists vs. new page)\n  - Comprehensive API request logging with method, endpoint, timing\n  - API error logging with status code and response body\n  - Network failure vs API error distinction via `_categorize_error()`\n  - request_id from response headers included in logs (from metadata)\n  - Slow operation warnings for operations >1 second\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log all API requests with method, endpoint, timing ✓\n  - Log API errors with status code and response body ✓\n  - Implement retry logic with attempt logging ✓\n  - Log network failures distinctly from API errors ✓\n  - Include request_id from response headers in logs ✓\n  - Log cache hits/misses at DEBUG level ✓\n- **Railway deployment requirements met:**\n  - API base URL from environment variable (VITE_API_URL via Crawl4AI settings) ✓\n  - Handle API errors gracefully (returns CrawlResult with error info) ✓\n  - Implement retry logic for transient failures ✓\n  - Support both HTTP and HTTPS (Railway provides SSL) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Fetch-only mode is useful for refreshing content without full site discovery\n  - Use `_categorize_error()` to distinguish network failures (timeout, connection) from API errors (4xx, 5xx)\n  - Cache hit/miss semantics: \"hit\" = page exists in DB (may still need refresh), \"miss\" = new page\n  - The `update_existing` flag controls whether to skip or update existing pages\n  - Retry logic should not retry 4xx client errors except 429 rate limit\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.30\n- Implemented progress tracking and WebSocket broadcasts for real-time crawl progress\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/websocket.py` - Added `broadcast_progress_update()` method and new logger methods\n  - `backend/app/services/crawl.py` - Integrated WebSocket broadcasts into `run_crawl()` with `_broadcast_progress()` helper\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `broadcast_progress_update()` in ConnectionManager for broadcasting crawl progress to subscribers\n  - `broadcast_failure()` logger method for per-client broadcast failure logging\n  - `progress_broadcast_sent()` logger method for successful progress broadcasts\n  - `progress_update_no_subscribers()` logger method for DEBUG level logging when no subscribers\n  - `_broadcast_progress()` helper in CrawlService that converts CrawlProgress to dict and broadcasts\n  - Progress broadcasts at key moments: crawl start (status=running), periodic updates (every 10 pages), completion, and failure\n  - WebSocket message format: `{type: \"progress_update\", project_id, crawl_id, progress, timestamp}`\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log connection open/close with client info ✓ (already existed from c3y.22)\n  - Log message send/receive at DEBUG level ✓ (already existed)\n  - Log connection errors and reconnection attempts ✓ (already existed)\n  - Include connection_id in all WebSocket logs ✓ (already existed + new broadcast_failure method)\n  - Log broadcast failures per-client ✓ (NEW: broadcast_failure() method)\n  - Log heartbeat timeouts at WARNING level ✓ (already existed)\n  - Railway supports WebSocket connections ✓ (already existed)\n  - Heartbeat/ping to keep connections alive ✓ (already existed, 30s interval)\n  - Handle reconnection gracefully ✓ (already existed, reconnect_advice in messages)\n  - Fallback to polling ✓ (documented as client-side responsibility)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - WebSocket progress broadcasts should be fire-and-forget (don't fail crawl if broadcast fails)\n  - Progress data should include all relevant metrics: pages_crawled, pages_failed, pages_skipped, urls_discovered, current_depth, status, timestamps\n  - Broadcast at key state transitions: start, periodic (every 10 pages), complete, and failure\n  - Use separate logger methods for broadcast success vs failure for clear observability\n  - Import `connection_manager` singleton from `app.core.websocket` for broadcasting\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.31\n- Created `/api/v1/projects/{id}/phases/crawl` endpoints for crawl phase management\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/schemas/crawl.py` - Pydantic schemas for crawl API (CrawlStartRequest, CrawlHistoryResponse, CrawledPageResponse, etc.)\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/crawl.py` - Crawl phase REST endpoints with full error logging\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - Wired up crawl router under `/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl`\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Exported crawl schemas\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `POST /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl` - Start a new crawl (returns 202 Accepted, runs in background)\n  - `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl` - List crawl history with pagination and status filter\n  - `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl/{crawl_id}` - Get specific crawl details\n  - `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl/{crawl_id}/progress` - Get crawl progress (pages crawled, failed, skipped, etc.)\n  - `POST /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl/{crawl_id}/stop` - Stop a running crawl\n  - `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl/pages` - List crawled pages with pagination and category filter\n  - `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl/pages/{page_id}` - Get specific crawled page\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log all incoming requests with method, path, request_id ✓\n  - Log request body at DEBUG level (sanitize sensitive fields) ✓\n  - Log response status and timing for every request ✓\n  - Return structured error responses: {\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str} ✓\n  - Log 4xx errors at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR ✓\n  - Include request_id in all responses for debugging ✓\n- **Railway deployment requirements met:**\n  - CORS via FRONTEND_URL env var (existing config) ✓\n  - Proper error responses with request_id ✓\n  - Background task execution for long-running crawls ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `BackgroundTasks` for fire-and-forget crawl execution (production should use Celery)\n  - Return 202 Accepted for async operations that complete in background\n  - Project ownership validation: verify crawl/page belongs to requested project_id before returning\n  - Nested router prefix pattern: `prefix=\"/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl\"` extracts project_id from path\n  - Pydantic `ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)` enables direct SQLAlchemy model validation\n---\n\n","numLines":944,"startLine":1,"totalLines":944}}}

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### Backend Layered Architecture\nThe backend follows a strict layered architecture pattern:\n- `app/api/` - FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n\n### Database Logging Pattern\nUse `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n\n### Configuration Pattern\nAll config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n\n### SQLite Test Fixtures Pattern\nTests use SQLite in-memory for speed. PostgreSQL types need adaptation:\n- `conftest.py` has `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function\n- UUID columns → String(36), JSONB columns → JSON\n- PostgreSQL-specific server_default values are cleared (gen_random_uuid, ::jsonb, now())\n- Use `StaticPool` with `check_same_thread=False` for SQLite async\n- Session-scoped engine, per-test session with rollback for isolation\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.1\n- Completed backend project structure initialization\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - SQLAlchemy models layer\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Pydantic schemas layer\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - External service clients layer\n  - `backend/app/workers/__init__.py` - Background task processing layer\n  - `backend/Procfile` - Railway deployment start command\n- Files already existed (verified):\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Environment-based config\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Structured logging with all required DB logging\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Async SQLAlchemy with pool management\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - FastAPI app with health checks and SIGTERM handling\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - API router setup\n  - `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Services layer\n  - `backend/app/repositories/__init__.py` - Repositories layer\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The backend was partially initialized in a previous iteration\n  - All Railway deployment requirements were already in place (PORT binding, health endpoints, SIGTERM handling)\n  - All error logging requirements were already implemented in `app/core/logging.py`\n  - Use `python3 -m py_compile` for quick syntax verification without needing dependencies installed\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.2\n- Completed FastAPI application setup with CORS, exception handlers, and OpenAPI docs\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added request logging middleware, exception handlers, and rate limit logging\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `RequestLoggingMiddleware` - Logs all requests with method, path, request_id, timing, and status codes\n  - `sanitize_body()` - Redacts sensitive fields (password, token, secret, etc.) from request body logs\n  - Request body logging at DEBUG level for non-GET requests\n  - Structured error responses with format `{\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str}`\n  - Exception handlers for: validation errors (422), rate limits (429), and general exceptions (500)\n  - `log_rate_limit_hit()` helper function for rate limit logging at WARNING level\n  - X-Request-ID header added to all responses\n  - Log levels: 4xx at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR, success at INFO\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - CORS middleware\n  - OpenAPI docs (conditional on debug mode)\n  - /health endpoint returning `{\"status\": \"ok\"}`\n  - SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown\n  - PORT from environment variable\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `request.state.request_id` to pass request_id through the request lifecycle\n  - BaseHTTPMiddleware is the standard way to add request logging in FastAPI\n  - Exception handlers are registered with `@app.exception_handler()`\n  - Rate limit exception handler uses status code `429` directly, can be triggered by rate limiting libraries\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.3\n- Configured SQLAlchemy with async support and PostgreSQL connection\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Added SSL mode and connection timeout handling\n  -

All required database logging (connection errors, slow queries, transaction failures, pool exhaustion)\n  - DATABASE_URL conversion from `postgres://` to `postgresql+asyncpg://`\n  - Session management with `get_session()` dependency and `transaction()` context manager\n- **Learnings:**\n  - asyncpg uses `connect_args` dict for `timeout` and `command_timeout` (not SQLAlchemy-level params)\n  - Alembic async migrations require `async_engine_from_config` and `connection.run_sync()` pattern\n  - Railway Procfile supports chained commands with `&&` for running migrations before server start\n  - SSL mode is added via URL query param, check for existing `?` to use `&` separator\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.4\n- Verified Alembic database migrations already complete (implemented in c3y.3)\n- No files changed - all requirements already satisfied\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Database connection error logging with masked connection string ✓\n  - Slow query logging (>100ms) at WARNING level ✓\n  - Transaction failure logging with rollback context ✓\n  - Migration start/end logging with version info ✓\n  - Table/model name in database error logs ✓\n  -

`alembic upgrade head` in deploy command ✓\n  - PostgreSQL only (PostgresDsn type) ✓\n  - SSL mode (sslmode=require) ✓\n  - Auto-generation support (target_metadata = Base.metadata) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The c3y.3 bead fully implemented Alembic setup including all c3y.4 requirements\n  - When beads share requirements, verify against specific checklist before implementing\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.5\n- Added Redis client with connection pooling and circuit breaker pattern\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Added Redis pool size, timeouts, and circuit breaker settings\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Added `RedisLogger` class with comprehensive logging\n  - `backend/app/core/redis.py` - Created new Redis client module (connection pooling, circuit breaker)\n  - `backend/app/core/__init__.py` - Exported Redis components\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added Redis initialization/shutdown and health check endpoint\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `CircuitBreaker` class with CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN states for fault tolerance\n  - `RedisManager` class with connection pooling via redis-py `ConnectionPool`\n  - SSL/TLS support via `rediss://` URL detection (Railway uses SSL)\n  - Connection retry logic with exponential backoff for cold starts\n  - Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable (all methods return None)\n  - Comprehensive logging: connection errors (masked URL), timeouts, circuit state changes\n  - Health check endpoint at `/health/redis` with circuit breaker state\n  - Convenience methods: get, set, delete, exists, expire, ttl, incr, decr, hash ops, list ops\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log all outbound API calls with endpoint, method, timing ✓\n  -

Connect via REDIS_URL environment variable ✓\n  - Handle Redis connection failures gracefully (cache is optional) ✓\n  - Use SSL/TLS for Redis connections in production ✓\n  - Implement connection retry logic for cold starts ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - redis-py's `ConnectionPool.from_url()` auto-detects SSL from `rediss://` scheme\n  - Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures: track failures → open circuit → wait recovery_timeout → half-open test → close on success\n  - Use `asyncio.Lock()` to protect circuit breaker state changes in async context\n  - Railway sets `REDIS_URL` with `rediss://` prefix for TLS connections\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.6\n- Created pytest configuration with fixtures for database and Redis mocking\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/tests/__init__.py` - Test package marker\n  - `backend/tests/conftest.py` - Pytest fixtures for testing\n  - `backend/tests/test_fixtures.py` - Sample tests verifying fixtures work\n- **What was implemented:**\n  -

pytest configuration in `pyproject.toml` with asyncio_mode=\"auto\"\n  - Dev dependencies including pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, aiosqlite\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `StaticPool` for SQLite to ensure same connection is reused in session scope\n  - aiosqlite requires `check_same_thread=False` in connect_args\n  - MockRedis must implement both bytes return values (like real Redis) and clear() for test isolation\n  - Use `ASGITransport` with httpx `AsyncClient` for async testing FastAPI\n  - Fixtures that mock global singletons must store/restore original state\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.7\n- Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline with lint, test, and type-check jobs\n- Files created:\n  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions CI workflow\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/pyproject.toml` - Added ruff and mypy to dev dependencies, configured both tools\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Added explicit type annotation for formatter variable\n  - `backend/app/core/redis.py` - Fixed type annotations for dict/list return types, added AsyncGenerator import\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` -

Log mock/stub invocations for debugging (DEBUG level) ✓\n  - Tests work with DATABASE_URL env var ✓\n  - Use test database, not production ✓\n  - CI mirrors Railway environment (Python 3.11, env vars) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - MyPy `ignore_missing_imports = true` doesn't prevent \"cannot subclass Any\" errors - use `disallow_subclassing_any = false` for specific modules\n  - Ruff's `--output-format=github` produces GitHub-compatible annotations for inline error display\n  - pydantic-settings and pythonjsonlogger need explicit module entries (not just `.*` patterns) in mypy overrides\n  - Use `ruff check --fix` for auto-fixable issues, then manually address remaining warnings\n  - CI jobs run in parallel by default - use `needs:` to create dependencies between jobs\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.8\n- Configured Railway deployment for staging environment\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/railway.toml` - Railway configuration with health check, nixpacks builder, and staging env vars\n  - `backend/app/deploy.py` - Deployment script with comprehensive logging (runs migrations, validates env, health checks)\n  -

`phase_status` JSONB field with default empty object `'{}'::jsonb` for flexible phase tracking\n  - Indexed columns: name, client_id, status for efficient queries\n  - Timestamps: created_at and updated_at with server defaults\n  - Migration creates table with proper PostgreSQL types (UUID, JSONB, TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `UUID(as_uuid=False)` to store UUIDs as strings in SQLAlchemy, avoiding UUID object serialization issues\n  - JSONB `server_default` requires `text(\"'{}'::jsonb\")` syntax, not just `text(\"{}\")`\n  - `mapped_column` with `default=dict` provides Python-side default, `server_default` provides database-side\n  - Alembic migrations should use modern Python type annotations (`str | None` vs `Union[str, None]`)\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.10\n- Created CrawledPage model with normalized_url, category, labels JSONB fields\n- Files created:\n  -

Individual indexes on project_id, normalized_url, category for queries\n- **Learnings:**\n  - For JSONB arrays, use `default=list` for Python-side and `server_default=text(\"'[]'::jsonb\")` for database-side\n  - Use `sa.ForeignKeyConstraint` in migrations for foreign keys with named constraints and `ondelete` behavior\n  - Composite unique indexes prevent duplicate URLs within the same project while allowing same URL across projects\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 -

Use `time.monotonic()` for FIFO timestamps instead of `time.time()` to avoid clock drift issues\n  - Exclude patterns should still mark URLs as seen to avoid re-checking\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.27\n- Implemented CrawlService with include/exclude pattern matching\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/services/crawl.py` - Full CrawlService with PatternMatcher and crawl orchestration\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Export CrawlService and related classes\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `PatternMatcher` class for URL include/exclude pattern filtering using fnmatch\n  - `CrawlConfig` and `CrawlProgress` dataclasses for crawl configuration and tracking\n  - `CrawlService` class with full crawl orchestration:\n    -

Crawl job management\n    - `save_crawled_page()` / `get_crawled_pages()` - Page persistence\n    - `start_crawl()` / `run_crawl()` - Crawl execution with URLPriorityQueue and Crawl4AI\n  - Custom exceptions: `CrawlServiceError`, `CrawlValidationError`, `CrawlNotFoundError`, `CrawlPatternError`\n  - Comprehensive validation: UUID format, URL format, crawl status, pagination\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log method entry/exit at DEBUG level with parameters (sanitized) ✓\n  - Log all exceptions with full stack trace and context via `exc_info=True` ✓\n  - Include entity IDs (project_id, crawl_id, page_id) in all service logs ✓\n  - Log validation failures with field names and rejected values at WARNING level ✓\n  - Log state transitions (crawl status changes) at INFO level ✓\n  -

The (project_id, normalized_url) composite unique index enforces deduplication at DB level\n  - `get_urls_for_project()` returns a set for O(1) membership tests during batch operations\n  - Provide `get_changed_pages()` for incremental processing workflows (pages modified since timestamp)\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.29\n- Added fetch-only mode for re-crawling specific URLs without full crawl discovery\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/services/crawl.py` - Added `fetch_urls()`, `_fetch_url_with_retry()`, `_get_existing_page()`, `_categorize_error()` methods\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `fetch_urls()` - Re-crawl specific URLs without URLPriorityQueue discovery\n  - Retry logic with exponential backoff (configurable max_retries and base_delay)\n  - Cache hit/miss logging at DEBUG level (page exists vs. new page)\n  - Comprehensive API request logging with method, endpoint, timing\n  - API error logging with status code and response body\n  - Network failure vs API error distinction via `_categorize_error()`\n  - request_id from response headers included in logs (from metadata)\n  - Slow operation warnings for operations >1 second\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log all API requests with method, endpoint, timing ✓\n  - Log API errors with status code and response body ✓\n  -

Support both HTTP and HTTPS (Railway provides SSL) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Fetch-only mode is useful for refreshing content without full site discovery\n  - Use `_categorize_error()` to distinguish network failures (timeout, connection) from API errors (4xx, 5xx)\n  - Cache hit/miss semantics: \"hit\" = page exists in DB (may still need refresh), \"miss\" = new page\n  - The `update_existing` flag controls whether to skip or update existing pages\n  - Retry logic should not retry 4xx client errors except 429 rate limit\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.30\n- Implemented progress tracking and WebSocket broadcasts for real-time crawl progress\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/websocket.py` - Added `broadcast_progress_update()` method and new logger methods\n  - `backend/app/services/crawl.py` - Integrated WebSocket broadcasts into `run_crawl()` with `_broadcast_progress()` helper\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `broadcast_progress_update()` in ConnectionManager for broadcasting crawl progress to subscribers\n  - `broadcast_failure()` logger method for per-client broadcast failure logging\n  - `progress_broadcast_sent()` logger method for successful progress broadcasts\n  - `progress_update_no_subscribers()` logger method for DEBUG level logging when no subscribers\n  - `_broadcast_progress()` helper in CrawlService that converts CrawlProgress to dict and broadcasts\n  - Progress broadcasts at key moments: crawl start (status=running), periodic updates (every 10 pages), completion, and failure\n  - WebSocket message format: `{type: \"progress_update\", project_id, crawl_id, progress, timestamp}`\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log connection open/close with client info ✓ (already existed from c3y.22)\n  - Log message send/receive at DEBUG level ✓ (already existed)\n  - Log connection errors and reconnection attempts ✓ (already existed)\n  - Include connection_id in all WebSocket logs ✓ (already existed + new broadcast_failure method)\n  - Log broadcast failures per-client ✓ (NEW: broadcast_failure() method)\n  - Log heartbeat timeouts at WARNING level ✓ (already existed)\n  - Railway supports WebSocket connections ✓ (already existed)\n  - Heartbeat/ping to keep connections alive ✓ (already existed, 30s interval)\n  - Handle reconnection gracefully ✓ (already existed, reconnect_advice in messages)\n  - Fallback to polling ✓ (documented as client-side responsibility)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - WebSocket progress broadcasts should be fire-and-forget (don't fail crawl if broadcast fails)\n  - Progress data should include all relevant metrics: pages_crawled, pages_failed, pages_skipped, urls_discovered, current_depth, status, timestamps\n  - Broadcast at key state transitions: start, periodic (every 10 pages), complete, and failure\n  - Use separate logger methods for broadcast success vs failure for clear observability\n  - Import `connection_manager` singleton from `app.core.websocket` for broadcasting\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.31\n- Created `/api/v1/projects/{id}/phases/crawl` endpoints for crawl phase management\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/schemas/crawl.py` - Pydantic schemas for crawl API (CrawlStartRequest, CrawlHistoryResponse, CrawledPageResponse, etc.)\n  -

CORS via FRONTEND_URL env var (existing config) ✓\n  - Proper error responses with request_id ✓\n  - Background task execution for long-running crawls ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `BackgroundTasks` for fire-and-forget crawl execution (production should use Celery)\n  - Return 202 Accepted for async operations that complete in background\n  - Project ownership validation: verify crawl/page belongs to requested project_id before returning\n  - Nested router prefix pattern: `prefix=\"/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl\"` extracts project_id from path\n  - Pydantic `ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)` enables direct SQLAlchemy model validation\n---\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":941,"oldLines":3,"newStart":941,"newLines":41,"lines":["   - Pydantic `ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)` enables direct SQLAlchemy model validation"," ---"," ","+## 2026-02-01 -
