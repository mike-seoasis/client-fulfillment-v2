Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### Backend Layered Architecture\nThe backend follows a strict layered architecture pattern:\n- `app/api/` - FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n\n### Database Logging Pattern\nUse `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n\n### Configuration Pattern\nAll config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n\n### SQLite Test Fixtures Pattern\nTests use SQLite in-memory for speed. PostgreSQL types need adaptation:\n- `conftest.py` has `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function\n- UUID columns → String(36), JSONB columns → JSON\n- PostgreSQL-specific server_default values are cleared (gen_random_uuid, ::jsonb, now())\n- Use `StaticPool` with `check_same_thread=False` for SQLite async\n- Session-scoped engine, per-test session with rollback for isolation\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.1\n- Completed backend project structure initialization\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - SQLAlchemy models layer\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Pydantic schemas layer\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - External service clients layer\n  - `backend/app/workers/__init__.py` - Background task processing layer\n  - `backend/Procfile` - Railway deployment start command\n- Files already existed (verified):\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Environment-based config\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Structured logging with all required DB logging\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Async SQLAlchemy with pool management\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - FastAPI app with health checks and SIGTERM handling\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - API router setup\n  - `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Services layer\n  - `backend/app/repositories/__init__.py` - Repositories layer\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The backend was partially initialized in a previous iteration\n  - All Railway deployment requirements were already in place (PORT binding, health endpoints, SIGTERM handling)\n  - All error logging requirements were already implemented in `app/core/logging.py`\n  - Use `python3 -m py_compile` for quick syntax verification without needing dependencies installed\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.2\n- Completed FastAPI application setup with CORS, exception handlers, and OpenAPI docs\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added request logging middleware, exception handlers, and rate limit logging\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `RequestLoggingMiddleware` - Logs all requests with method, path, request_id, timing, and status codes\n  - `sanitize_body()` - Redacts sensitive fields (password, token, secret, etc.) from request body logs\n  - Request body logging at DEBUG level for non-GET requests\n  - Structured error responses with format `{\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str}`\n  - Exception handlers for: validation errors (422), rate limits (429), and general exceptions (500)\n  - `log_rate_limit_hit()` helper function for rate limit logging at WARNING level\n  - X-Request-ID header added to all responses\n  - Log levels: 4xx at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR, success at INFO\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - CORS middleware\n  - OpenAPI docs (conditional on debug mode)\n  - /health endpoint returning `{\"status\": \"ok\"}`\n  - SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown\n  - PORT from environment variable\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `request.state.request_id` to pass request_id through the request lifecycle\n  - BaseHTTPMiddleware is the standard way to add request logging in FastAPI\n  - Exception handlers are registered with `@app.exception_handler()`\n  - Rate limit exception handler uses status code `429` directly, can be triggered by rate limiting libraries\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.3\n- Configured SQLAlchemy with async support and PostgreSQL connection\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Added SSL mode and connection timeout handling\n  -

All required database logging (connection errors, slow queries, transaction failures, pool exhaustion)\n  - DATABASE_URL conversion from `postgres://` to `postgresql+asyncpg://`\n  - Session management with `get_session()` dependency and `transaction()` context manager\n- **Learnings:**\n  - asyncpg uses `connect_args` dict for `timeout` and `command_timeout` (not SQLAlchemy-level params)\n  - Alembic async migrations require `async_engine_from_config` and `connection.run_sync()` pattern\n  - Railway Procfile supports chained commands with `&&` for running migrations before server start\n  - SSL mode is added via URL query param, check for existing `?` to use `&` separator\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.4\n- Verified Alembic database migrations already complete (implemented in c3y.3)\n- No files changed - all requirements already satisfied\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Database connection error logging with masked connection string ✓\n  -

Created new Redis client module (connection pooling, circuit breaker)\n  - `backend/app/core/__init__.py` - Exported Redis components\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added Redis initialization/shutdown and health check endpoint\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `CircuitBreaker` class with CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN states for fault tolerance\n  - `RedisManager` class with connection pooling via redis-py `ConnectionPool`\n  - SSL/TLS support via `rediss://` URL detection (Railway uses SSL)\n  - Connection retry logic with exponential backoff for cold starts\n  - Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable (all methods return None)\n  - Comprehensive logging: connection errors (masked URL), timeouts, circuit state changes\n  - Health check endpoint at `/health/redis` with circuit breaker state\n  - Convenience methods: get, set, delete, exists, expire, ttl, incr, decr, hash ops, list ops\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log all outbound API calls with endpoint, method, timing ✓\n  -

Connect via REDIS_URL environment variable ✓\n  - Handle Redis connection failures gracefully (cache is optional) ✓\n  - Use SSL/TLS for Redis connections in production ✓\n  - Implement connection retry logic for cold starts ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - redis-py's `ConnectionPool.from_url()` auto-detects SSL from `rediss://` scheme\n  - Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures: track failures → open circuit → wait recovery_timeout → half-open test → close on success\n  - Use `asyncio.Lock()` to protect circuit breaker state changes in async context\n  - Railway sets `REDIS_URL` with `rediss://` prefix for TLS connections\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.6\n- Created pytest configuration with fixtures for database and Redis mocking\n- Files created:\n  -

pytest configuration in `pyproject.toml` with asyncio_mode=\"auto\"\n  - Dev dependencies including pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, aiosqlite\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `StaticPool` for SQLite to ensure same connection is reused in session scope\n  - aiosqlite requires `check_same_thread=False` in connect_args\n  - MockRedis must implement both bytes return values (like real Redis) and clear() for test isolation\n  - Use `ASGITransport` with httpx `AsyncClient` for async testing FastAPI\n  - Fixtures that mock global singletons must store/restore original state\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.7\n- Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline with lint, test, and type-check jobs\n- Files created:\n  -

MyPy `ignore_missing_imports = true` doesn't prevent \"cannot subclass Any\" errors - use `disallow_subclassing_any = false` for specific modules\n  - Ruff's `--output-format=github` produces GitHub-compatible annotations for inline error display\n  - pydantic-settings and pythonjsonlogger need explicit module entries (not just `.*` patterns) in mypy overrides\n  - Use `ruff check --fix` for auto-fixable issues, then manually address remaining warnings\n  - CI jobs run in parallel by default - use `needs:` to create dependencies between jobs\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.8\n- Configured Railway deployment for staging environment\n- Files created:\n  -

Cache hit/miss semantics: \"hit\" = page exists in DB (may still need refresh), \"miss\" = new page\n  - The `update_existing` flag controls whether to skip or update existing pages\n  - Retry logic should not retry 4xx client errors except 429 rate limit\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.30\n- Implemented progress tracking and WebSocket broadcasts for real-time crawl progress\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/websocket.py` - Added `broadcast_progress_update()` method and new logger methods\n  - `backend/app/services/crawl.py` - Integrated WebSocket broadcasts into `run_crawl()` with `_broadcast_progress()` helper\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `broadcast_progress_update()` in ConnectionManager for broadcasting crawl progress to subscribers\n  - `broadcast_failure()` logger method for per-client broadcast failure logging\n  - `progress_broadcast_sent()` logger method for successful progress broadcasts\n  - `progress_update_no_subscribers()` logger method for DEBUG level logging when no subscribers\n  - `_broadcast_progress()` helper in CrawlService that converts CrawlProgress to dict and broadcasts\n  - Progress broadcasts at key moments: crawl start (status=running), periodic updates (every 10 pages), completion, and failure\n  - WebSocket message format: `{type: \"progress_update\", project_id, crawl_id, progress, timestamp}`\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log connection open/close with client info ✓ (already existed from c3y.22)\n  -

Python's `fnmatch` uses shell-style globbing where `*` matches ANY characters including `/`, unlike pathlib's glob\n  - pytest fixtures with `@pytest.fixture` decorator cause mypy \"untyped decorator\" warnings in strict mode - this is expected behavior\n  - Tests should be organized by feature area: URL normalization, pattern matching, validation, exceptions\n  - URLNormalizationOptions provides fine-grained control: `strip_www`, `allowed_query_params`, `blocked_query_params`\n  - PatternMatcher checks exclude patterns first (precedence), then include patterns\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.33\n- Implemented URL pattern rules for categorizing crawled pages into semantic categories\n- Files created:\n  -

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### Backend Layered Architecture\nThe backend follows a strict layered architecture pattern:\n- `app/api/` - FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n\n### Database Logging Pattern\nUse `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n\n### Configuration Pattern\nAll config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n\n### SQLite Test Fixtures Pattern\nTests use SQLite in-memory for speed. PostgreSQL types need adaptation:\n- `conftest.py` has `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function\n- UUID columns → String(36), JSONB columns → JSON\n- PostgreSQL-specific server_default values are cleared (gen_random_uuid, ::jsonb, now())\n- Use `StaticPool` with `check_same_thread=False` for SQLite async\n- Session-scoped engine, per-test session with rollback for isolation\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.1\n- Completed backend project structure initialization\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - SQLAlchemy models layer\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Pydantic schemas layer\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - External service clients layer\n  - `backend/app/workers/__init__.py` - Background task processing layer\n  - `backend/Procfile` - Railway deployment start command\n- Files already existed (verified):\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Environment-based config\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Structured logging with all required DB logging\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Async SQLAlchemy with pool management\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - FastAPI app with health checks and SIGTERM handling\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - API router setup\n  - `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Services layer\n  - `backend/app/repositories/__init__.py` - Repositories layer\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The backend was partially initialized in a previous iteration\n  - All Railway deployment requirements were already in place (PORT binding, health endpoints, SIGTERM handling)\n  - All error logging requirements were already implemented in `app/core/logging.py`\n  - Use `python3 -m py_compile` for quick syntax verification without needing dependencies installed\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.2\n- Completed FastAPI application setup with CORS, exception handlers, and OpenAPI docs\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added request logging middleware, exception handlers, and rate limit logging\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `RequestLoggingMiddleware` - Logs all requests with method, path, request_id, timing, and status codes\n  - `sanitize_body()` - Redacts sensitive fields (password, token, secret, etc.) from request body logs\n  - Request body logging at DEBUG level for non-GET requests\n  - Structured error responses with format `{\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str}`\n  - Exception handlers for: validation errors (422), rate limits (429), and general exceptions (500)\n  - `log_rate_limit_hit()` helper function for rate limit logging at WARNING level\n  - X-Request-ID header added to all responses\n  - Log levels: 4xx at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR, success at INFO\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - CORS middleware\n  - OpenAPI docs (conditional on debug mode)\n  - /health endpoint returning `{\"status\": \"ok\"}`\n  - SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown\n  - PORT from environment variable\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `request.state.request_id` to pass request_id through the request lifecycle\n  - BaseHTTPMiddleware is the standard way to add request logging in FastAPI\n  - Exception handlers are registered with `@app.exception_handler()`\n  - Rate limit exception handler uses status code `429` directly, can be triggered by rate limiting libraries\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.3\n- Configured SQLAlchemy with async support and PostgreSQL connection\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Added SSL mode and connection timeout handling\n  -

Migration logging using `db_logger.migration_start()` and `db_logger.migration_end()`\n  - Railway deploy command: `alembic upgrade head && uvicorn ...`\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - Async SQLAlchemy engine with connection pooling (pool_size=5, max_overflow=10)\n  - All required database logging (connection errors, slow queries, transaction failures, pool exhaustion)\n  - DATABASE_URL conversion from `postgres://` to `postgresql+asyncpg://`\n  - Session management with `get_session()` dependency and `transaction()` context manager\n- **Learnings:**\n  - asyncpg uses `connect_args` dict for `timeout` and `command_timeout` (not SQLAlchemy-level params)\n  - Alembic async migrations require `async_engine_from_config` and `connection.run_sync()` pattern\n  - Railway Procfile supports chained commands with `&&` for running migrations before server start\n  - SSL mode is added via URL query param, check for existing `?` to use `&` separator\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.4\n- Verified Alembic database migrations already complete (implemented in c3y.3)\n- No files changed - all requirements already satisfied\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Database connection error logging with masked connection string ✓\n  - Slow query logging (>100ms) at WARNING level ✓\n  - Transaction failure logging with rollback context ✓\n  - Migration start/end logging with version info ✓\n  - Table/model name in database error logs ✓\n  - Connection pool exhaustion at CRITICAL level ✓\n  - DATABASE_URL environment variable ✓\n  - Connection pooling (pool_size=5, max_overflow=10) ✓\n  - Connection timeout handling for Railway cold-starts ✓\n  - `alembic upgrade head` in deploy command ✓\n  - PostgreSQL only (PostgresDsn type) ✓\n  - SSL mode (sslmode=require) ✓\n  - Auto-generation support (target_metadata = Base.metadata) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The c3y.3 bead fully implemented Alembic setup including all c3y.4 requirements\n  - When beads share requirements, verify against specific checklist before implementing\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.5\n- Added Redis client with connection pooling and circuit breaker pattern\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Added Redis pool size, timeouts, and circuit breaker settings\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Added `RedisLogger` class with comprehensive logging\n  - `backend/app/core/redis.py` - Created new Redis client module (connection pooling, circuit breaker)\n  - `backend/app/core/__init__.py` - Exported Redis components\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added Redis initialization/shutdown and health check endpoint\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `CircuitBreaker` class with CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN states for fault tolerance\n  - `RedisManager` class with connection pooling via redis-py `ConnectionPool`\n  - SSL/TLS support via `rediss://` URL detection (Railway uses SSL)\n  - Connection retry logic with exponential backoff for cold starts\n  - Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable (all methods return None)\n  - Comprehensive logging: connection errors (masked URL), timeouts, circuit state changes\n  - Health check endpoint at `/health/redis` with circuit breaker state\n  - Convenience methods: get, set, delete, exists, expire, ttl, incr, decr, hash ops, list ops\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log all outbound API calls with endpoint, method, timing ✓\n  -

Connect via REDIS_URL environment variable ✓\n  - Handle Redis connection failures gracefully (cache is optional) ✓\n  - Use SSL/TLS for Redis connections in production ✓\n  - Implement connection retry logic for cold starts ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - redis-py's `ConnectionPool.from_url()` auto-detects SSL from `rediss://` scheme\n  - Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures: track failures → open circuit → wait recovery_timeout → half-open test → close on success\n  - Use `asyncio.Lock()` to protect circuit breaker state changes in async context\n  - Railway sets `REDIS_URL` with `rediss://` prefix for TLS connections\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.6\n- Created pytest configuration with fixtures for database and Redis mocking\n- Files created:\n  -

pytest configuration in `pyproject.toml` with asyncio_mode=\"auto\"\n  - Dev dependencies including pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, aiosqlite\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `StaticPool` for SQLite to ensure same connection is reused in session scope\n  - aiosqlite requires `check_same_thread=False` in connect_args\n  - MockRedis must implement both bytes return values (like real Redis) and clear() for test isolation\n  - Use `ASGITransport` with httpx `AsyncClient` for async testing FastAPI\n  - Fixtures that mock global singletons must store/restore original state\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.7\n- Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline with lint, test, and type-check jobs\n- Files created:\n  -

Pytest with coverage, DEBUG-level logging, full tracebacks, and timing info\n  - Coverage report artifact upload\n  - All-checks gate job that fails if any job fails\n  - DATABASE_URL and test env vars set for CI\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Test failures include full assertion context (`--tb=long`) ✓\n  - Log test setup/teardown at DEBUG level (`--log-cli-level=DEBUG`) ✓\n  - Capture and display logs from failed tests ✓\n  - Include timing information in test reports (`--durations=10`) ✓\n  - Log mock/stub invocations for debugging (DEBUG level) ✓\n  - Tests work with DATABASE_URL env var ✓\n  - Use test database, not production ✓\n  - CI mirrors Railway environment (Python 3.11, env vars) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - MyPy `ignore_missing_imports = true` doesn't prevent \"cannot subclass Any\" errors - use `disallow_subclassing_any = false` for specific modules\n  - Ruff's `--output-format=github` produces GitHub-compatible annotations for inline error display\n  - pydantic-settings and pythonjsonlogger need explicit module entries (not just `.*` patterns) in mypy overrides\n  - Use `ruff check --fix` for auto-fixable issues, then manually address remaining warnings\n  - CI jobs run in parallel by default - use `needs:` to create dependencies between jobs\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.8\n- Configured Railway deployment for staging environment\n- Files created:\n  -

WebSocket close codes: 1000 for normal, 1001 for going away, 1006 for abnormal\n  - Send reconnect_advice with `should_reconnect`, `initial_delay_ms`, `max_delay_ms`, `backoff_multiplier`\n  - Use `asyncio.Task` for background heartbeat loop, cancel on shutdown\n  - Track `last_ping` and `last_pong` timestamps per connection for timeout detection\n  - Broadcast shutdown before stopping heartbeat to give clients reconnection info\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.23\n- Created comprehensive unit tests for ProjectService achieving 83% code coverage\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/tests/services/__init__.py` - Test package marker\n  - `backend/tests/services/test_project_service.py` - 63 unit tests for ProjectService\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/tests/conftest.py` - Added SQLite type adaptation for PostgreSQL types (UUID, JSONB, server_default)\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - Test classes: TestCreateProject, TestGetProject, TestGetProjectOrNone, TestGetProjectsByClient, TestGetProjectsByStatus, TestListProjects, TestUpdateProject, TestStatusTransitions, TestUpdatePhaseStatus, TestPhaseTransitions, TestDeleteProject, TestProjectExists, TestExceptionClasses\n  - Tests cover all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)\n  - Tests cover validation logic (UUID format, status values, phase transitions)\n  - Tests cover business rules (status transitions, phase state machine)\n  - Tests cover error handling (ProjectNotFoundError, ProjectValidationError, InvalidPhaseTransitionError)\n  - Parametrized tests for status transitions (7 valid, 4 invalid)\n  - Parametrized tests for phase transitions (6 valid, 4 invalid)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - PostgreSQL-specific types (UUID, JSONB) and server_default values don't work with SQLite\n  - Need to adapt column types and clear PostgreSQL-specific server_default values for SQLite testing\n  - Use `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function to iterate over Base.metadata.tables and modify column types\n  - Pydantic schema validation happens before service-level validation, so test schema errors at schema level\n  - Session-scoped fixtures with `StaticPool` ensure consistent database state across tests\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 -
