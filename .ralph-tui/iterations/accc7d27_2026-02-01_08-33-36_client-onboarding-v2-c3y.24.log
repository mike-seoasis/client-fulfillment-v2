Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### Backend Layered Architecture\nThe backend follows a strict layered architecture pattern:\n- `app/api/` - FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n\n### Database Logging Pattern\nUse `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n\n### Configuration Pattern\nAll config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n\n### SQLite Test Fixtures Pattern\nTests use SQLite in-memory for speed. PostgreSQL types need adaptation:\n- `conftest.py` has `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function\n- UUID columns → String(36), JSONB columns → JSON\n- PostgreSQL-specific server_default values are cleared (gen_random_uuid, ::jsonb, now())\n- Use `StaticPool` with `check_same_thread=False` for SQLite async\n- Session-scoped engine, per-test session with rollback for isolation\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.1\n- Completed backend project structure initialization\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - SQLAlchemy models layer\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Pydantic schemas layer\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - External service clients layer\n  - `backend/app/workers/__init__.py` - Background task processing layer\n  - `backend/Procfile` -

`backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Services layer\n  - `backend/app/repositories/__init__.py` - Repositories layer\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The backend was partially initialized in a previous iteration\n  - All Railway deployment requirements were already in place (PORT binding, health endpoints, SIGTERM handling)\n  - All error logging requirements were already implemented in `app/core/logging.py`\n  - Use `python3 -m py_compile` for quick syntax verification without needing dependencies installed\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.2\n- Completed FastAPI application setup with CORS, exception handlers, and OpenAPI docs\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added request logging middleware, exception handlers, and rate limit logging\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `RequestLoggingMiddleware` - Logs all requests with method, path, request_id, timing, and status codes\n  - `sanitize_body()` - Redacts sensitive fields (password, token, secret, etc.) from request body logs\n  - Request body logging at DEBUG level for non-GET requests\n  - Structured error responses with format `{\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str}`\n  - Exception handlers for: validation errors (422), rate limits (429), and general exceptions (500)\n  - `log_rate_limit_hit()` helper function for rate limit logging at WARNING level\n  - X-Request-ID header added to all responses\n  - Log levels: 4xx at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR, success at INFO\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - CORS middleware\n  - OpenAPI docs (conditional on debug mode)\n  - /health endpoint returning `{\"status\": \"ok\"}`\n  - SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown\n  - PORT from environment variable\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `request.state.request_id` to pass request_id through the request lifecycle\n  - BaseHTTPMiddleware is the standard way to add request logging in FastAPI\n  - Exception handlers are registered with `@app.exception_handler()`\n  - Rate limit exception handler uses status code `429` directly, can be triggered by rate limiting libraries\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.3\n- Configured SQLAlchemy with async support and PostgreSQL connection\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Added SSL mode and connection timeout handling\n  -

All required database logging (connection errors, slow queries, transaction failures, pool exhaustion)\n  - DATABASE_URL conversion from `postgres://` to `postgresql+asyncpg://`\n  - Session management with `get_session()` dependency and `transaction()` context manager\n- **Learnings:**\n  - asyncpg uses `connect_args` dict for `timeout` and `command_timeout` (not SQLAlchemy-level params)\n  - Alembic async migrations require `async_engine_from_config` and `connection.run_sync()` pattern\n  - Railway Procfile supports chained commands with `&&` for running migrations before server start\n  - SSL mode is added via URL query param, check for existing `?` to use `&` separator\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.4\n- Verified Alembic database migrations already complete (implemented in c3y.3)\n- No files changed - all requirements already satisfied\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Database connection error logging with masked connection string ✓\n  -

Created new Redis client module (connection pooling, circuit breaker)\n  - `backend/app/core/__init__.py` - Exported Redis components\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added Redis initialization/shutdown and health check endpoint\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `CircuitBreaker` class with CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN states for fault tolerance\n  - `RedisManager` class with connection pooling via redis-py `ConnectionPool`\n  - SSL/TLS support via `rediss://` URL detection (Railway uses SSL)\n  - Connection retry logic with exponential backoff for cold starts\n  - Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable (all methods return None)\n  - Comprehensive logging: connection errors (masked URL), timeouts, circuit state changes\n  -

Connect via REDIS_URL environment variable ✓\n  - Handle Redis connection failures gracefully (cache is optional) ✓\n  - Use SSL/TLS for Redis connections in production ✓\n  - Implement connection retry logic for cold starts ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - redis-py's `ConnectionPool.from_url()` auto-detects SSL from `rediss://` scheme\n  - Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures: track failures → open circuit → wait recovery_timeout → half-open test → close on success\n  - Use `asyncio.Lock()` to protect circuit breaker state changes in async context\n  - Railway sets `REDIS_URL` with `rediss://` prefix for TLS connections\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.6\n- Created pytest configuration with fixtures for database and Redis mocking\n- Files created:\n  -

pytest configuration in `pyproject.toml` with asyncio_mode=\"auto\"\n  - Dev dependencies including pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, aiosqlite\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `StaticPool` for SQLite to ensure same connection is reused in session scope\n  - aiosqlite requires `check_same_thread=False` in connect_args\n  - MockRedis must implement both bytes return values (like real Redis) and clear() for test isolation\n  - Use `ASGITransport` with httpx `AsyncClient` for async testing FastAPI\n  - Fixtures that mock global singletons must store/restore original state\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.7\n- Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline with lint, test, and type-check jobs\n- Files created:\n  -

Log mock/stub invocations for debugging (DEBUG level) ✓\n  - Tests work with DATABASE_URL env var ✓\n  - Use test database, not production ✓\n  - CI mirrors Railway environment (Python 3.11, env vars) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - MyPy `ignore_missing_imports = true` doesn't prevent \"cannot subclass Any\" errors - use `disallow_subclassing_any = false` for specific modules\n  - Ruff's `--output-format=github` produces GitHub-compatible annotations for inline error display\n  - pydantic-settings and pythonjsonlogger need explicit module entries (not just `.*` patterns) in mypy overrides\n  - Use `ruff check --fix` for auto-fixable issues, then manually address remaining warnings\n  - CI jobs run in parallel by default - use `needs:` to create dependencies between jobs\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.8\n- Configured Railway deployment for staging environment\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/railway.toml` - Railway configuration with health check, nixpacks builder, and staging env vars\n  - `backend/app/deploy.py` - Deployment script with comprehensive logging (runs migrations, validates env, health checks)\n  -

Added `migration_step()`, `rollback_triggered()`, `rollback_executed()` methods to DatabaseLogger\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - Deployment start/end logging with version info and Railway metadata (deployment ID, commit SHA)\n  - Migration step-by-step logging with success/failure status\n  - Environment variable validation with masked sensitive values\n  - Database and Redis health check verification during deployment\n  - Rollback trigger and execution logging\n  - `railway.toml` configuration for staging with health check path and restart policy\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log deployment start/end with version info ✓\n  - Log each migration step with success/failure status ✓\n  - Log rollback triggers and execution ✓\n  - Log environment variable validation (mask values) ✓\n  - Log health check results during deployment ✓\n  - Log database connection verification ✓\n  - Use railway.toml for configuration ✓\n  - Configure health check path in Railway settings ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Railway provides automatic env vars: `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_ID`, `RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME`, `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_NAME`, `RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`\n  - Use `python -m app.deploy` pattern to run a module as script for pre-start hooks\n  - `railway.toml` `startCommand` replaces Procfile when both exist\n  - Mask connection strings using pattern `://user:****@host` for safe logging\n  - Subprocess with `alembic --verbose` gives step-by-step migration output\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.9\n- Created Project model with phase_status JSONB field for workflow tracking\n- Files created:\n  -

`backend/app/models/__init__.py` - Export Project model\n  - `backend/alembic/env.py` - Import Project for Alembic auto-detection, fixed unused variable lint issue\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - Project model with UUID primary key using `gen_random_uuid()` server default\n  - `phase_status` JSONB field with default empty object `'{}'::jsonb` for flexible phase tracking\n  - Indexed columns: name, client_id, status for efficient queries\n  - Timestamps: created_at and updated_at with server defaults\n  - Migration creates table with proper PostgreSQL types (UUID, JSONB, TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `UUID(as_uuid=False)` to store UUIDs as strings in SQLAlchemy, avoiding UUID object serialization issues\n  - JSONB `server_default` requires `text(\"'{}'::jsonb\")` syntax, not just `text(\"{}\")`\n  - `mapped_column` with `default=dict` provides Python-side default, `server_default` provides database-side\n  - Alembic migrations should use modern Python type annotations (`str | None` vs `Union[str, None]`)\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.10\n- Created CrawledPage model with normalized_url, category, labels JSONB fields\n- Files created:\n  -

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### Backend Layered Architecture\nThe backend follows a strict layered architecture pattern:\n- `app/api/` - FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n\n### Database Logging Pattern\nUse `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n\n### Configuration Pattern\nAll config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n\n### SQLite Test Fixtures Pattern\nTests use SQLite in-memory for speed. PostgreSQL types need adaptation:\n- `conftest.py` has `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function\n- UUID columns → String(36), JSONB columns → JSON\n- PostgreSQL-specific server_default values are cleared (gen_random_uuid, ::jsonb, now())\n- Use `StaticPool` with `check_same_thread=False` for SQLite async\n- Session-scoped engine, per-test session with rollback for isolation\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.1\n- Completed backend project structure initialization\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - SQLAlchemy models layer\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Pydantic schemas layer\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - External service clients layer\n  - `backend/app/workers/__init__.py` - Background task processing layer\n  - `backend/Procfile` - Railway deployment start command\n- Files already existed (verified):\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Environment-based config\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Structured logging with all required DB logging\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Async SQLAlchemy with pool management\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - FastAPI app with health checks and SIGTERM handling\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - API router setup\n  -

`backend/app/repositories/__init__.py` - Export ProjectRepository\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `create()` - Create new project with name, client_id, status, phase_status\n  - `get_by_id()` - Fetch project by UUID\n  - `get_by_client_id()` - Fetch all projects for a client\n  - `get_by_status()` - Fetch projects by status\n  - `list_all()` - Paginated list of all projects\n  - `update()` - Update project fields\n  - `update_phase_status()` - Convenience method for updating individual phase statuses\n  - `delete()` - Delete project by ID\n  - `exists()` - Check if project exists\n  - `count()` / `count_by_status()` - Count projects\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - DEBUG level entry/exit logging with parameters (sanitized)\n  - Full stack trace on exceptions via `exc_info=True`\n  - Entity IDs (project_id) included in all logs\n  - State transitions (status and phase changes) logged at INFO level\n  - Timing logs for operations >1 second via `db_logger.slow_query()`\n  - Transaction failures logged via `db_logger.transaction_failure()`\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `session.flush()` + `session.refresh()` to get server-generated values (like UUID) after insert\n  - `select().scalar_one_or_none()` is the async-friendly way to get optional single result\n  - `result.rowcount` from delete gives affected row count for determining if delete was successful\n  - Phase status changes should be logged individually by comparing old vs new dict keys\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.19\n- Implemented ProjectService with validation logic\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/schemas/project.py` - Pydantic schemas for Project API validation\n  - `backend/app/services/project.py` - ProjectService with business logic and validation\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Export Project schemas\n  - `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Export ProjectService and exceptions\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `ProjectCreate`, `ProjectUpdate`, `PhaseStatusUpdate` schemas with field validation\n  - `ProjectResponse`, `ProjectListResponse` schemas for API responses\n  - Constants: `VALID_PROJECT_STATUSES`, `VALID_PHASE_STATUSES`, `VALID_PHASES`\n  - `ProjectService` class with all CRUD methods:\n    - `create_project()` - Create with validation\n    - `get_project()` / `get_project_or_none()` - Fetch by ID\n    - `get_projects_by_client()` / `get_projects_by_status()` - Filtered queries\n    - `list_projects()` -

Delete by ID\n    - `project_exists()` - Check existence\n  - Custom exceptions: `ProjectServiceError`, `ProjectNotFoundError`, `ProjectValidationError`, `InvalidPhaseTransitionError`\n  - Status transition rules: active → completed/on_hold/cancelled, on_hold → active/cancelled, completed/cancelled → archived\n  - Phase transition rules: pending → in_progress/skipped, in_progress → completed/blocked, blocked → in_progress/skipped\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - DEBUG level entry/exit logging with parameters (sanitized)\n  - Full stack trace on exceptions via `exc_info=True`\n  - Entity IDs (project_id) included in all service logs\n  - Validation failures logged with field names and rejected values at WARNING level\n  - State transitions (phase changes) logged at INFO level\n  - Timing logs for operations >1 second\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Service layer validates business rules (transitions) while schema layer validates data format\n  - Use `frozenset` for immutable constant sets (faster lookup, thread-safe)\n  - Pydantic `field_validator` with `@classmethod` decorator for custom validation\n  - Combine multiple conditions in single `if` for SIM102 linting rule\n  - Service methods should re-raise `ProjectServiceError` subclasses, catch and log other exceptions\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.20\n- Verified Pydantic schemas for Project create/update/response already complete (implemented in c3y.19)\n- No files changed - all requirements already satisfied\n- **Verified schemas:**\n  - `ProjectCreate` - Create schema with name, client_id, status, phase_status validation ✓\n  - `ProjectUpdate` - Update schema with optional fields and validators ✓\n  - `ProjectResponse` - Response schema with all fields and `from_attributes=True` ✓\n  - `PhaseStatusEntry` - Single phase status entry with validation ✓\n  - `PhaseStatusUpdate` - Update single phase with phase/status validation ✓\n  - `ProjectListResponse` - Paginated list with items, total, limit, offset ✓\n  - `VALID_PROJECT_STATUSES`, `VALID_PHASE_STATUSES`, `VALID_PHASES` - Validation constants ✓\n- **Validation rules verified:**\n  - Project status must be in valid set (active, completed, on_hold, cancelled, archived)\n  - Phase names must be valid (discovery, requirements, implementation, review, launch)\n  - Phase statuses must be valid (pending, in_progress, completed, blocked, skipped)\n  - Name and client_id cannot be empty/whitespace\n  - All schemas exported from `app.schemas.__init__`\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The c3y.19 bead fully implemented Project schemas - c3y.20 was redundant\n  - When beads share requirements, verify against specific checklist before implementing\n  - Always check progress.md for what was already implemented in related beads\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.21\n- Implemented /api/v1/projects endpoints with full CRUD operations\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/__init__.py` - Endpoints package marker\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/projects.py` - Projects API router with all endpoints\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - Wired up projects router\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `GET /api/v1/projects` - List projects with pagination (limit, offset)\n  - `POST /api/v1/projects` - Create a new project with validation\n  - `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}` - Get project by UUID\n  - `PUT /api/v1/projects/{project_id}` - Update project with transition validation\n  - `DELETE /api/v1/projects/{project_id}` - Delete project by UUID (204 No Content)\n  - `PATCH /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases` - Update single phase status\n  - All endpoints include request_id in structured error responses\n  - DEBUG-level request logging with sanitized parameters\n  - WARNING-level logging for validation errors and not-found cases\n  - Proper error codes: VALIDATION_ERROR, NOT_FOUND, INVALID_TRANSITION\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log all incoming requests with method, path, request_id (via middleware in main.py) ✓\n  - Log request body at DEBUG level (sanitize sensitive fields) (via middleware) ✓\n  - Log response status and timing for every request (via middleware) ✓\n  - Return structured error responses: {\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str} ✓\n  - Log 4xx errors at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR ✓\n  - Include request_id in all responses (X-Request-ID header via middleware) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - FastAPI allows returning `JSONResponse` directly for error cases even when `response_model` is set\n  - Use `response_model` for success cases, return `JSONResponse` with explicit status code for errors\n  - `model_validate()` converts SQLAlchemy models to Pydantic using `from_attributes=True` config\n  - Access request_id from `request.state.request_id` set by middleware\n  - MyPy struggles with FastAPI's union return types; use `# type: ignore[return-value]` when needed\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.22\n- Implemented WebSocket endpoint for real-time project status updates\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/core/websocket.py` - WebSocket connection manager, logger, and connection state management\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/websocket.py` - WebSocket endpoint at `/api/v1/ws/projects` with health check\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/__init__.py` - Export `connection_manager` and `ws_logger`\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - Wire up WebSocket router\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Start/stop heartbeat task in lifespan, broadcast shutdown to WebSocket clients\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `ConnectionManager` class with connection tracking by ID and project subscription\n  - `WebSocketConnection` dataclass with state tracking, subscription management, and heartbeat timestamps\n  - `WebSocketLogger` class with comprehensive logging for connections, messages, subscriptions, heartbeats\n  - Heartbeat/ping mechanism (30s interval, 90s timeout) for Railway connection keepalive\n  - Reconnection guidance in all connection/shutdown messages with exponential backoff advice\n  - Message protocol: subscribe, unsubscribe, ping, pong, project_update, shutdown, error\n  - `broadcast_project_update()` for sending updates to all subscribers of a project\n  - `broadcast_shutdown()` for graceful shutdown notification to all clients\n  - Health check endpoint at `/api/v1/ws/health` with connection count and heartbeat status\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Railway supports WebSocket connections ✓\n  - Heartbeat/ping keeps connections alive (30s interval) ✓\n  - Handle reconnection gracefully with exponential backoff advice ✓\n  - Log all incoming connections with connection_id ✓\n  - Log connection close with reason and code ✓\n  - Log message send/receive at DEBUG level ✓\n  - Log errors at ERROR level with full context ✓\n  - Log subscription changes at INFO level ✓\n  - Log heartbeat timeouts at WARNING level ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - FastAPI WebSocket uses `@router.websocket()` decorator, not `@router.get()`\n  - Use `contextlib.suppress()` instead of try/except/pass for cleaner code (ruff SIM105)\n  - Heartbeat interval should be less than Railway's idle timeout (typically 60s)\n  - WebSocket close codes: 1000 for normal, 1001 for going away, 1006 for abnormal\n  - Send reconnect_advice with `should_reconnect`, `initial_delay_ms`, `max_delay_ms`, `backoff_multiplier`\n  - Use `asyncio.Task` for background heartbeat loop, cancel on shutdown\n  - Track `last_ping` and `last_pong` timestamps per connection for timeout detection\n  - Broadcast shutdown before stopping heartbeat to give clients reconnection info\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.23\n- Created comprehensive unit tests for ProjectService achieving 83% code coverage\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/tests/services/__init__.py` - Test package marker\n  - `backend/tests/services/test_project_service.py` - 63 unit tests for ProjectService\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/tests/conftest.py` - Added SQLite type adaptation for PostgreSQL types (UUID, JSONB, server_default)\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - Test classes: TestCreateProject, TestGetProject, TestGetProjectOrNone, TestGetProjectsByClient, TestGetProjectsByStatus, TestListProjects, TestUpdateProject, TestStatusTransitions, TestUpdatePhaseStatus, TestPhaseTransitions, TestDeleteProject, TestProjectExists, TestExceptionClasses\n  - Tests cover all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)\n  - Tests cover validation logic (UUID format, status values, phase transitions)\n  - Tests cover business rules (status transitions, phase state machine)\n  - Tests cover error handling (ProjectNotFoundError, ProjectValidationError, InvalidPhaseTransitionError)\n  - Parametrized tests for status transitions (7 valid, 4 invalid)\n  - Parametrized tests for phase transitions (6 valid, 4 invalid)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - PostgreSQL-specific types (UUID, JSONB) and server_default values don't work with SQLite\n  - Need to adapt column types and clear PostgreSQL-specific server_default values for SQLite testing\n  - Use `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function to iterate over Base.metadata.tables and modify column types\n  - Pydantic schema validation happens before service-level validation, so test schema errors at schema level\n  - Session-scoped fixtures with `StaticPool` ensure consistent database state across tests\n---\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":678,"oldLines":3,"newStart":678,"newLines":42,"lines":["   -
