Agents update this file\n     4→after each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n     5→\n     6→## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n     7→\n     8→### Backend Layered Architecture\n     9→The backend follows a strict layered architecture pattern:\n    10→- `app/api/` - FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n    11→- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n    12→- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n    13→- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n    14→- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n    15→- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n    16→- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n    17→- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n    18→\n    19→### Database Logging Pattern\n    20→Use `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n    21→- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n    22→- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n    23→- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n    24→- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n    25→\n    26→### Configuration Pattern\n    27→All config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n    28→- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n    29→- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n    30→- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n    31→\n    32→---\n    33→\n    34→## 2026-01-31 -

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### Backend Layered Architecture\nThe backend follows a strict layered architecture pattern:\n- `app/api/` - FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n\n### Database Logging Pattern\nUse `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n\n### Configuration Pattern\nAll config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.1\n- Completed backend project structure initialization\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - SQLAlchemy models layer\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Pydantic schemas layer\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - External service clients layer\n  - `backend/app/workers/__init__.py` - Background task processing layer\n  - `backend/Procfile` - Railway deployment start command\n- Files already existed (verified):\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Environment-based config\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Structured logging with all required DB logging\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Async SQLAlchemy with pool management\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - FastAPI app with health checks and SIGTERM handling\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - API router setup\n  - `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Services layer\n  - `backend/app/repositories/__init__.py` - Repositories layer\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The backend was partially initialized in a previous iteration\n  - All Railway deployment requirements were already in place (PORT binding, health endpoints, SIGTERM handling)\n  - All error logging requirements were already implemented in `app/core/logging.py`\n  - Use `python3 -m py_compile` for quick syntax verification without needing dependencies installed\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.2\n- Completed FastAPI application setup with CORS, exception handlers, and OpenAPI docs\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added request logging middleware, exception handlers, and rate limit logging\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `RequestLoggingMiddleware` - Logs all requests with method, path, request_id, timing, and status codes\n  - `sanitize_body()` - Redacts sensitive fields (password, token, secret, etc.) from request body logs\n  - Request body logging at DEBUG level for non-GET requests\n  - Structured error responses with format `{\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str}`\n  - Exception handlers for: validation errors (422), rate limits (429), and general exceptions (500)\n  - `log_rate_limit_hit()` helper function for rate limit logging at WARNING level\n  - X-Request-ID header added to all responses\n  - Log levels: 4xx at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR, success at INFO\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - CORS middleware\n  - OpenAPI docs (conditional on debug mode)\n  - /health endpoint returning `{\"status\": \"ok\"}`\n  - SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown\n  - PORT from environment variable\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `request.state.request_id` to pass request_id through the request lifecycle\n  - BaseHTTPMiddleware is the standard way to add request logging in FastAPI\n  - Exception handlers are registered with `@app.exception_handler()`\n  - Rate limit exception handler uses status code `429` directly, can be triggered by rate limiting libraries\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.3\n- Configured SQLAlchemy with async support and PostgreSQL connection\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Added SSL mode and connection timeout handling\n  -

All required database logging (connection errors, slow queries, transaction failures, pool exhaustion)\n  - DATABASE_URL conversion from `postgres://` to `postgresql+asyncpg://`\n  - Session management with `get_session()` dependency and `transaction()` context manager\n- **Learnings:**\n  - asyncpg uses `connect_args` dict for `timeout` and `command_timeout` (not SQLAlchemy-level params)\n  - Alembic async migrations require `async_engine_from_config` and `connection.run_sync()` pattern\n  - Railway Procfile supports chained commands with `&&` for running migrations before server start\n  - SSL mode is added via URL query param, check for existing `?` to use `&` separator\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 -

Created new Redis client module (connection pooling, circuit breaker)\n  - `backend/app/core/__init__.py` - Exported Redis components\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added Redis initialization/shutdown and health check endpoint\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `CircuitBreaker` class with CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN states for fault tolerance\n  - `RedisManager` class with connection pooling via redis-py `ConnectionPool`\n  - SSL/TLS support via `rediss://` URL detection (Railway uses SSL)\n  - Connection retry logic with exponential backoff for cold starts\n  - Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable (all methods return None)\n  - Comprehensive logging: connection errors (masked URL), timeouts, circuit state changes\n  - Health check endpoint at `/health/redis` with circuit breaker state\n  - Convenience methods: get, set, delete, exists, expire, ttl, incr, decr, hash ops, list ops\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log all outbound API calls with endpoint, method, timing ✓\n  -

Connect via REDIS_URL environment variable ✓\n  - Handle Redis connection failures gracefully (cache is optional) ✓\n  - Use SSL/TLS for Redis connections in production ✓\n  - Implement connection retry logic for cold starts ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - redis-py's `ConnectionPool.from_url()` auto-detects SSL from `rediss://` scheme\n  - Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures: track failures → open circuit → wait recovery_timeout → half-open test → close on success\n  - Use `asyncio.Lock()` to protect circuit breaker state changes in async context\n  - Railway sets `REDIS_URL` with `rediss://` prefix for TLS connections\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.6\n- Created pytest configuration with fixtures for database and Redis mocking\n- Files created:\n  -

pytest configuration in `pyproject.toml` with asyncio_mode=\"auto\"\n  - Dev dependencies including pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, aiosqlite\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `StaticPool` for SQLite to ensure same connection is reused in session scope\n  - aiosqlite requires `check_same_thread=False` in connect_args\n  - MockRedis must implement both bytes return values (like real Redis) and clear() for test isolation\n  - Use `ASGITransport` with httpx `AsyncClient` for async testing FastAPI\n  - Fixtures that mock global singletons must store/restore original state\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.7\n- Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline with lint, test, and type-check jobs\n- Files created:\n  -

`backend/alembic/env.py` - Import PageKeywords for Alembic auto-detection\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - PageKeywords model with foreign key to crawled_pages table (CASCADE delete)\n  - `primary_keyword` (Text, indexed) - The main target keyword for the page\n  - `secondary_keywords` JSONB array field with default empty array `'[]'::jsonb`\n  - Optional fields: search_volume (Integer), difficulty_score (Integer) for SEO metrics\n  - Indexes on crawled_page_id and primary_keyword for query performance\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Follow established model patterns: UUID(as_uuid=False), JSONB with both Python default and server_default\n  - PageKeywords relates to CrawledPage (one-to-many: a page can have one keyword entry)\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.12\n- Created PagePAA model for People Also Ask (PAA) enrichment data\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/page_paa.py` - PagePAA model with UUID PK, crawled_page_id FK, question, answer_snippet, related_questions JSONB array\n  - `backend/alembic/versions/0004_create_page_paa_table.py` - Migration for page_paa table with foreign key and indexes\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - Export PagePAA model\n  - `backend/alembic/env.py` - Import PagePAA for Alembic auto-detection\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - PagePAA model with foreign key to crawled_pages table (CASCADE delete)\n  - `question` (Text, indexed) - The PAA question from search results\n  - `answer_snippet` (Text, nullable) - Brief answer snippet if available\n  - `source_url` (Text, nullable) - URL of the source providing the answer\n  - `related_questions` JSONB array field with default empty array `'[]'::jsonb`\n  - `position` (Integer, nullable) - Position in PAA results (1-based)\n  - Indexes on crawled_page_id and question for query performance\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Consistent with PageKeywords pattern: one-to-many relationship from CrawledPage\n  - PAA data typically includes question, answer, source, and related follow-up questions\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.13\n- Created BrandConfig model with v2_schema JSONB field for brand configuration storage\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/brand_config.py` - BrandConfig model with UUID PK, project_id FK, brand_name, domain, v2_schema JSONB\n  - `backend/alembic/versions/0005_create_brand_configs_table.py` - Migration for brand_configs table with foreign key and indexes\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - Export BrandConfig model\n  - `backend/alembic/env.py` - Import BrandConfig for Alembic auto-detection\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - BrandConfig model with foreign key to projects table (CASCADE delete)\n  - `brand_name` (String 255, indexed) - Display name of the brand\n  - `domain` (Text, nullable, indexed) - Primary domain for the brand\n  - `v2_schema` JSONB object field with default empty object `'{}'::jsonb`\n  - Timestamps: created_at and updated_at with server defaults\n  - Indexes on project_id, brand_name, and domain for query performance\n- **Learnings:**\n  - BrandConfig follows established model pattern: UUID(as_uuid=False), JSONB with both Python default and server_default\n  - V2 schema JSONB stores flexible brand configuration (colors, typography, logo, voice, social)\n  - One-to-many relationship from Project to BrandConfig (a project can have multiple brand configs)\n---\n\n","numLines":371,"startLine":1,"totalLines":371}}}

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### Backend Layered Architecture\nThe backend follows a strict layered architecture pattern:\n- `app/api/` - FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n\n### Database Logging Pattern\nUse `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n\n### Configuration Pattern\nAll config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.1\n- Completed backend project structure initialization\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - SQLAlchemy models layer\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Pydantic schemas layer\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - External service clients layer\n  - `backend/app/workers/__init__.py` - Background task processing layer\n  - `backend/Procfile` - Railway deployment start command\n- Files already existed (verified):\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Environment-based config\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Structured logging with all required DB logging\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Async SQLAlchemy with pool management\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - FastAPI app with health checks and SIGTERM handling\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - API router setup\n  - `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Services layer\n  - `backend/app/repositories/__init__.py` - Repositories layer\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The backend was partially initialized in a previous iteration\n  - All Railway deployment requirements were already in place (PORT binding, health endpoints, SIGTERM handling)\n  - All error logging requirements were already implemented in `app/core/logging.py`\n  - Use `python3 -m py_compile` for quick syntax verification without needing dependencies installed\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.2\n- Completed FastAPI application setup with CORS, exception handlers, and OpenAPI docs\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added request logging middleware, exception handlers, and rate limit logging\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `RequestLoggingMiddleware` - Logs all requests with method, path, request_id, timing, and status codes\n  - `sanitize_body()` - Redacts sensitive fields (password, token, secret, etc.) from request body logs\n  - Request body logging at DEBUG level for non-GET requests\n  - Structured error responses with format `{\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str}`\n  - Exception handlers for: validation errors (422), rate limits (429), and general exceptions (500)\n  - `log_rate_limit_hit()` helper function for rate limit logging at WARNING level\n  - X-Request-ID header added to all responses\n  - Log levels: 4xx at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR, success at INFO\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - CORS middleware\n  - OpenAPI docs (conditional on debug mode)\n  - /health endpoint returning `{\"status\": \"ok\"}`\n  - SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown\n  - PORT from environment variable\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `request.state.request_id` to pass request_id through the request lifecycle\n  - BaseHTTPMiddleware is the standard way to add request logging in FastAPI\n  - Exception handlers are registered with `@app.exception_handler()`\n  - Rate limit exception handler uses status code `429` directly, can be triggered by rate limiting libraries\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.3\n- Configured SQLAlchemy with async support and PostgreSQL connection\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Added SSL mode and connection timeout handling\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Added `db_connect_timeout` and `db_command_timeout` settings\n  - `backend/alembic.ini` - Created Alembic configuration for async migrations\n  - `backend/alembic/env.py` -

SSL mode enforced via `sslmode=require` query parameter\n  - Connection timeout (60s) and command timeout (60s) for Railway cold-starts via asyncpg `connect_args`\n  - Full Alembic async migration setup with `async_engine_from_config`\n  - Migration logging using `db_logger.migration_start()` and `db_logger.migration_end()`\n  - Railway deploy command: `alembic upgrade head && uvicorn ...`\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - Async SQLAlchemy engine with connection pooling (pool_size=5, max_overflow=10)\n  - All required database logging (connection errors, slow queries, transaction failures, pool exhaustion)\n  - DATABASE_URL conversion from `postgres://` to `postgresql+asyncpg://`\n  - Session management with `get_session()` dependency and `transaction()` context manager\n- **Learnings:**\n  - asyncpg uses `connect_args` dict for `timeout` and `command_timeout` (not SQLAlchemy-level params)\n  - Alembic async migrations require `async_engine_from_config` and `connection.run_sync()` pattern\n  - Railway Procfile supports chained commands with `&&` for running migrations before server start\n  - SSL mode is added via URL query param, check for existing `?` to use `&` separator\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.4\n- Verified Alembic database migrations already complete (implemented in c3y.3)\n- No files changed - all requirements already satisfied\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Database connection error logging with masked connection string ✓\n  - Slow query logging (>100ms) at WARNING level ✓\n  - Transaction failure logging with rollback context ✓\n  - Migration start/end logging with version info ✓\n  - Table/model name in database error logs ✓\n  -

`backend/app/core/config.py` - Added Redis pool size, timeouts, and circuit breaker settings\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Added `RedisLogger` class with comprehensive logging\n  - `backend/app/core/redis.py` - Created new Redis client module (connection pooling, circuit breaker)\n  - `backend/app/core/__init__.py` - Exported Redis components\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added Redis initialization/shutdown and health check endpoint\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `CircuitBreaker` class with CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN states for fault tolerance\n  - `RedisManager` class with connection pooling via redis-py `ConnectionPool`\n  - SSL/TLS support via `rediss://` URL detection (Railway uses SSL)\n  - Connection retry logic with exponential backoff for cold starts\n  - Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable (all methods return None)\n  - Comprehensive logging: connection errors (masked URL), timeouts, circuit state changes\n  - Health check endpoint at `/health/redis` with circuit breaker state\n  - Convenience methods: get, set, delete, exists, expire, ttl, incr, decr, hash ops, list ops\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log all outbound API calls with endpoint, method, timing ✓\n  - Log request/response at DEBUG level ✓\n  - Log and handle: timeouts, rate limits, auth failures ✓\n  - Include retry attempt number in logs ✓\n  - Mask API keys and tokens in all logs ✓\n  - Log circuit breaker state changes ✓\n  - Connect via REDIS_URL environment variable ✓\n  - Handle Redis connection failures gracefully (cache is optional) ✓\n  - Use SSL/TLS for Redis connections in production ✓\n  - Implement connection retry logic for cold starts ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - redis-py's `ConnectionPool.from_url()` auto-detects SSL from `rediss://` scheme\n  - Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures: track failures → open circuit → wait recovery_timeout → half-open test → close on success\n  - Use `asyncio.Lock()` to protect circuit breaker state changes in async context\n  - Railway sets `REDIS_URL` with `rediss://` prefix for TLS connections\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.6\n- Created pytest configuration with fixtures for database and Redis mocking\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/tests/__init__.py` - Test package marker\n  - `backend/tests/conftest.py` - Pytest fixtures for testing\n  - `backend/tests/test_fixtures.py` - Sample tests verifying fixtures work\n- **What was implemented:**\n  -

`mock_redis_manager` - Mocks global `redis_manager` with MockRedis\n  - `mock_redis_unavailable` - Simulates Redis being unavailable (for graceful degradation tests)\n  - `client` - Sync TestClient with mocked dependencies\n  - `async_client` - Async httpx AsyncClient for async endpoint tests\n  - `mock_logger` - For testing log output\n  - `freeze_time` - Utility for freezing time in tests\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - pytest configuration in `pyproject.toml` with asyncio_mode=\"auto\"\n  - Dev dependencies including pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, aiosqlite\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `StaticPool` for SQLite to ensure same connection is reused in session scope\n  - aiosqlite requires `check_same_thread=False` in connect_args\n  - MockRedis must implement both bytes return values (like real Redis) and clear() for test isolation\n  - Use `ASGITransport` with httpx `AsyncClient` for async testing FastAPI\n  - Fixtures that mock global singletons must store/restore original state\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.7\n- Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline with lint, test, and type-check jobs\n- Files created:\n  -

Pytest with coverage, DEBUG-level logging, full tracebacks, and timing info\n  - Coverage report artifact upload\n  - All-checks gate job that fails if any job fails\n  - DATABASE_URL and test env vars set for CI\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Test failures include full assertion context (`--tb=long`) ✓\n  - Log test setup/teardown at DEBUG level (`--log-cli-level=DEBUG`) ✓\n  - Capture and display logs from failed tests ✓\n  - Include timing information in test reports (`--durations=10`) ✓\n  - Log mock/stub invocations for debugging (DEBUG level) ✓\n  - Tests work with DATABASE_URL env var ✓\n  - Use test database, not production ✓\n  - CI mirrors Railway environment (Python 3.11, env vars) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - MyPy `ignore_missing_imports = true` doesn't prevent \"cannot subclass Any\" errors - use `disallow_subclassing_any = false` for specific modules\n  - Ruff's `--output-format=github` produces GitHub-compatible annotations for inline error display\n  - pydantic-settings and pythonjsonlogger need explicit module entries (not just `.*` patterns) in mypy overrides\n  - Use `ruff check --fix` for auto-fixable issues, then manually address remaining warnings\n  - CI jobs run in parallel by default - use `needs:` to create dependencies between jobs\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.8\n- Configured Railway deployment for staging environment\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/railway.toml` - Railway configuration with health check, nixpacks builder, and staging env vars\n  - `backend/app/deploy.py` - Deployment script with comprehensive logging (runs migrations, validates env, health checks)\n  - `backend/RAILWAY_ENV.md` - Documentation of all Railway environment variables\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/Procfile` - Updated to run `python -m app.deploy` before uvicorn start\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` -

`backend/app/models/__init__.py` - Export Project model\n  - `backend/alembic/env.py` - Import Project for Alembic auto-detection, fixed unused variable lint issue\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - Project model with UUID primary key using `gen_random_uuid()` server default\n  - `phase_status` JSONB field with default empty object `'{}'::jsonb` for flexible phase tracking\n  - Indexed columns: name, client_id, status for efficient queries\n  - Timestamps: created_at and updated_at with server defaults\n  - Migration creates table with proper PostgreSQL types (UUID, JSONB, TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `UUID(as_uuid=False)` to store UUIDs as strings in SQLAlchemy, avoiding UUID object serialization issues\n  - JSONB `server_default` requires `text(\"'{}'::jsonb\")` syntax, not just `text(\"{}\")`\n  - `mapped_column` with `default=dict` provides Python-side default, `server_default` provides database-side\n  - Alembic migrations should use modern Python type annotations (`str | None` vs `Union[str, None]`)\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.10\n- Created CrawledPage model with normalized_url, category, labels JSONB fields\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/crawled_page.py` - CrawledPage model with UUID PK, project_id FK, normalized_url, category, labels JSONB, timestamps\n  - `backend/alembic/versions/0002_create_crawled_pages_table.py` - Migration for crawled_pages table with foreign key and indexes\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - Export CrawledPage model\n  - `backend/alembic/env.py` - Import CrawledPage for Alembic auto-detection\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - CrawledPage model with foreign key to projects table (CASCADE delete)\n  - `normalized_url` (Text) - canonical URL after normalization\n  - `category` (String 100) - page classification (homepage, product, etc.)\n  - `labels` JSONB array field with default empty array `'[]'::jsonb`\n  - Additional fields: raw_url, title, content_hash, last_crawled_at\n  - Unique composite index on (project_id, normalized_url) to prevent duplicates\n  - Individual indexes on project_id, normalized_url, category for queries\n- **Learnings:**\n  - For JSONB arrays, use `default=list` for Python-side and `server_default=text(\"'[]'::jsonb\")` for database-side\n  - Use `sa.ForeignKeyConstraint` in migrations for foreign keys with named constraints and `ondelete` behavior\n  - Composite unique indexes prevent duplicate URLs within the same project while allowing same URL across projects\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.11\n- Created PageKeywords model with primary/secondary keyword structure\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/page_keywords.py` - PageKeywords model with UUID PK, crawled_page_id FK, primary_keyword, secondary_keywords JSONB array\n  - `backend/alembic/versions/0003_create_page_keywords_table.py` - Migration for page_keywords table with foreign key and indexes\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - Export PageKeywords model\n  - `backend/alembic/env.py` - Import PageKeywords for Alembic auto-detection\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - PageKeywords model with foreign key to crawled_pages table (CASCADE delete)\n  - `primary_keyword` (Text, indexed) - The main target keyword for the page\n  - `secondary_keywords` JSONB array field with default empty array `'[]'::jsonb`\n  - Optional fields: search_volume (Integer), difficulty_score (Integer) for SEO metrics\n  - Indexes on crawled_page_id and primary_keyword for query performance\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Follow established model patterns: UUID(as_uuid=False), JSONB with both Python default and server_default\n  - PageKeywords relates to CrawledPage (one-to-many: a page can have one keyword entry)\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.12\n- Created PagePAA model for People Also Ask (PAA) enrichment data\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/page_paa.py` - PagePAA model with UUID PK, crawled_page_id FK, question, answer_snippet, related_questions JSONB array\n  - `backend/alembic/versions/0004_create_page_paa_table.py` - Migration for page_paa table with foreign key and indexes\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - Export PagePAA model\n  - `backend/alembic/env.py` - Import PagePAA for Alembic auto-detection\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - PagePAA model with foreign key to crawled_pages table (CASCADE delete)\n  - `question` (Text, indexed) - The PAA question from search results\n  - `answer_snippet` (Text, nullable) - Brief answer snippet if available\n  - `source_url` (Text, nullable) - URL of the source providing the answer\n  - `related_questions` JSONB array field with default empty array `'[]'::jsonb`\n  - `position` (Integer, nullable) - Position in PAA results (1-based)\n  - Indexes on crawled_page_id and question for query performance\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Consistent with PageKeywords pattern: one-to-many relationship from CrawledPage\n  - PAA data typically includes question, answer, source, and related follow-up questions\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.13\n- Created BrandConfig model with v2_schema JSONB field for brand configuration storage\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/brand_config.py` - BrandConfig model with UUID PK, project_id FK, brand_name, domain, v2_schema JSONB\n  - `backend/alembic/versions/0005_create_brand_configs_table.py` - Migration for brand_configs table with foreign key and indexes\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - Export BrandConfig model\n  - `backend/alembic/env.py` - Import BrandConfig for Alembic auto-detection\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - BrandConfig model with foreign key to projects table (CASCADE delete)\n  - `brand_name` (String 255, indexed) -
