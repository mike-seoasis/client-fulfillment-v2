PostgreSQL types need adaptation:\n- `conftest.py` has `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function\n- UUID columns → String(36), JSONB columns → JSON\n- PostgreSQL-specific server_default values are cleared (gen_random_uuid, ::jsonb, now())\n- Use `StaticPool` with `check_same_thread=False` for SQLite async\n- Session-scoped engine, per-test session with rollback for isolation\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 -

Log request body at DEBUG level (sanitize sensitive fields) (via middleware) ✓\n  - Log response status and timing for every request (via middleware) ✓\n  - Return structured error responses: {\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str} ✓\n  - Log 4xx errors at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR ✓\n  - Include request_id in all responses (X-Request-ID header via middleware) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - FastAPI allows returning `JSONResponse` directly for error cases even when `response_model` is set\n  - Use `response_model` for success cases, return `JSONResponse` with explicit status code for errors\n  - `model_validate()` converts SQLAlchemy models to Pydantic using `from_attributes=True` config\n  - Access request_id from `request.state.request_id` set by middleware\n  - MyPy struggles with FastAPI's union return types; use `# type: ignore[return-value]` when needed\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.22\n- Implemented WebSocket endpoint for real-time project status updates\n- Files created:\n  -

`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/crawl.py` - Crawl phase REST endpoints with full error logging\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - Wired up crawl router under `/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl`\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Exported crawl schemas\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `POST /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl` - Start a new crawl (returns 202 Accepted, runs in background)\n  - `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl` - List crawl history with pagination and status filter\n  - `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl/{crawl_id}` - Get specific crawl details\n  - `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl/{crawl_id}/progress` - Get crawl progress (pages crawled, failed, skipped, etc.)\n  - `POST /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl/{crawl_id}/stop` - Stop a running crawl\n  - `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl/pages` - List crawled pages with pagination and category filter\n  - `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl/pages/{page_id}` - Get specific crawled page\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log all incoming requests with method, path, request_id ✓\n  - Log request body at DEBUG level (sanitize sensitive fields) ✓\n  - Log response status and timing for every request ✓\n  - Return structured error responses: {\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str} ✓\n  - Log 4xx errors at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR ✓\n  - Include request_id in all responses for debugging ✓\n- **Railway deployment requirements met:**\n  - CORS via FRONTEND_URL env var (existing config) ✓\n  - Proper error responses with request_id ✓\n  - Background task execution for long-running crawls ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `BackgroundTasks` for fire-and-forget crawl execution (production should use Celery)\n  - Return 202 Accepted for async operations that complete in background\n  - Project ownership validation: verify crawl/page belongs to requested project_id before returning\n  - Nested router prefix pattern: `prefix=\"/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl\"` extracts project_id from path\n  - Pydantic `ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)` enables direct SQLAlchemy model validation\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.32\n- Created comprehensive unit tests for CrawlService (URL normalization, pattern matching)\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/tests/services/test_crawl_service.py` - 85 unit tests for CrawlService\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - URL normalization tests (16 tests):\n    - Fragment removal, trailing slash handling, scheme/host lowercasing\n    - Query param sorting, tracking param removal, default port removal\n    - Error handling for empty/invalid URLs\n  - URLNormalizationOptions tests (6 tests):\n    - `strip_www`, `remove_query_params`, `keep_fragments`, `keep_trailing_slash`, `allowed_query_params`\n  - URLNormalizer.is_same_page tests (7 tests):\n    - Same page detection with fragment/trailing slash/case differences\n  - PatternMatcher tests (25 tests):\n    - Initialization with include/exclude patterns\n    - `matches_include()`, `matches_exclude()`, `should_crawl()` methods\n    - Pattern validation (empty patterns, too many wildcards)\n    - Priority determination (INCLUDE vs OTHER)\n  - Glob pattern syntax tests (5 tests):\n    - Single asterisk, double asterisk, question mark, character class, file extensions\n  - CrawlService pattern methods tests (8 tests):\n    - `create_pattern_matcher()`, `filter_urls()` with various pattern combinations\n  - Validation methods tests (12 tests):\n    - UUID validation, URL validation, crawl status validation, pagination validation\n  - Exception classes tests (5 tests):\n    - CrawlServiceError, CrawlValidationError, CrawlNotFoundError, CrawlPatternError hierarchy\n  - CrawlConfig/CrawlProgress dataclass tests (4 tests)\n- **Coverage achieved:**\n  - `app/utils/url.py`: 83% coverage\n  - `app/services/crawl.py` (URL normalization and pattern matching portions): tested\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Python's `fnmatch` uses shell-style globbing where `*` matches ANY characters including `/`, unlike pathlib's glob\n  - pytest fixtures with `@pytest.fixture` decorator cause mypy \"untyped decorator\" warnings in strict mode - this is expected behavior\n  - Tests should be organized by feature area: URL normalization, pattern matching, validation, exceptions\n  - URLNormalizationOptions provides fine-grained control: `strip_www`, `allowed_query_params`, `blocked_query_params`\n  - PatternMatcher checks exclude patterns first (precedence), then include patterns\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.33\n- Implemented URL pattern rules for categorizing crawled pages into semantic categories\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/utils/url_categorizer.py` - URLCategorizer class with CategoryRule, pattern rules, and category detection\n  - `backend/tests/utils/test_url_categorizer.py` - 70+ unit tests covering all category patterns\n- Files changed:\n  -

`CategoryRule` dataclass with regex pattern matching and priority-based ordering\n  - `URLCategorizer` class with configurable rules and default category\n  - Default pattern rules for 12 page categories:\n    - `homepage` (/, /index.html, /home) - priority 100\n    - `product` (/products/*, /product/*, /p/*, /shop/category/item) - priority 80\n    - `collection` (/collections/*, /category/*, /shop/*) - priority 70\n    - `blog` (/blog/*, /news/*, /articles/*, /posts/*) - priority 60\n    - `policy` (/privacy-policy, /terms-*, /legal/*, /refund-*, /cookie-*, /gdpr) - priority 50\n    - `about` (/about*, /company, /team, /our-story) - priority 40\n    - `contact` (/contact*, /locations, /store-locator) - priority 40\n    - `faq` (/faq, /help/*, /support/*, /kb/*) - priority 35\n    - `account` (/account, /login, /signup, /profile, /dashboard) - priority 30\n    - `cart` (/cart, /basket, /checkout) - priority 30\n    - `search` (/search*, /s?*, /find?) - priority 20\n    - `other` (default for unmatched URLs)\n  - Auto-categorization in `save_crawled_page()` with `auto_categorize=True` flag\n  - Category change logging at INFO level (state transition)\n  - Batch categorization via `categorize_many()` method\n  - `categorize_url()` convenience function with singleton instance\n  - `VALID_PAGE_CATEGORIES` frozenset for validation\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log method entry/exit at DEBUG level with parameters (sanitized URL to 200 chars) ✓\n  - Log all exceptions with full stack trace and context via `exc_info=True` ✓\n  - Log validation failures with field names and rejected values at WARNING level ✓\n  - Log state transitions (category changes) at INFO level ✓\n  - Add timing logs for operations >1 second via `SLOW_OPERATION_THRESHOLD_MS` ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `re.IGNORECASE` flag for case-insensitive URL matching (handles /PRODUCTS/WIDGET)\n  - Priority-based rule ordering allows fine-grained control over pattern precedence\n  - Product URLs (nested: /shop/cat/item) have higher priority than collection URLs (single: /shop/cat)\n  - Regex patterns should use `^` anchor to match from path start and `/?$` for optional trailing slash\n  - Singleton pattern via module-level `_default_categorizer` provides thread-safe reuse\n  - `frozenset` for `VALID_PAGE_CATEGORIES` ensures immutability and fast lookup\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.34\n- Implemented content signal detection for confidence boosting\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/utils/content_signals.py` - ContentSignalDetector class with signal patterns, detection, and confidence boosting\n  - `backend/tests/utils/test_content_signals.py` - 50 unit tests covering all signal detection scenarios\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/utils/__init__.py` - Exported content signal detection classes and functions\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `SignalType` enum with TITLE, HEADING, SCHEMA, META, BREADCRUMB, BODY signal types\n  - `ContentSignal` dataclass for detected signals (signal_type, category, confidence_boost, matched_text)\n  - `ContentAnalysis` dataclass for analysis results (url_category, url_confidence, signals, boosted_confidence, final_category)\n  - `SignalPattern` dataclass with regex patterns, priority-based ordering, and compiled pattern caching\n  - `ContentSignalDetector` class with:\n    - `detect_signals()` - Detect signals from various content types\n    - `analyze()` - Compute boosted confidence and optionally override category\n    - Pattern grouping by signal type for efficient lookup\n    - Support for multiple signals stacking (capped at max_boost=0.95)\n    - Category override when signals strongly indicate different category (min_override_boost=0.5)\n  - Default signal patterns for 12 categories: homepage, product, collection, blog, policy, about, contact, faq, account, cart, search\n  - Signal sources: title patterns, body text patterns, JSON-LD schema patterns, heading patterns, meta description, breadcrumbs\n  - `analyze_content_signals()` convenience function with singleton detector\n  - `VALID_SIGNAL_TYPES` frozenset for validation\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log method entry/exit at DEBUG level with parameters (sanitized) ✓\n  - Log all exceptions with full stack trace and context via `exc_info=True` ✓\n  - Include entity IDs (project_id, page_id) in all service logs ✓\n  - Log validation failures with field names and rejected values ✓\n  - Log state transitions (category changes/overrides) at INFO level ✓\n  - Add timing logs for operations >1 second via `SLOW_OPERATION_THRESHOLD_MS` ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Content signals complement URL-based categorization by analyzing page content\n  - Schema signals (JSON-LD @type) provide highest confidence boost (0.35-0.4)\n  - Title signals are next most reliable (0.25-0.35)\n  - Body signals are checked against first 10,000 chars for efficiency\n  - Priority-based pattern ordering allows fine-grained control over signal precedence\n  - Multiple signals for same category stack up to max_boost (0.95)\n  - Category override requires significant signal boost (min_override_boost=0.5) to prevent false overrides\n  - Use `re.IGNORECASE` for case-insensitive pattern matching\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.35\n- Created Claude/Anthropic LLM categorization client using Claude Haiku\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/integrations/claude.py` - Full Claude client with async HTTP, circuit breaker, retry logic, page categorization\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Added Claude settings (anthropic_api_key, claude_model, timeout, retries, circuit breaker)\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Added `ClaudeLogger` class with comprehensive API call logging\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - Exported Claude client and related classes\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `ClaudeClient` class with async HTTP client (httpx) directly calling Anthropic API\n  - `CircuitBreaker` class for fault tolerance (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN states)\n  - `CategorizationResult` and `CompletionResult` dataclasses for typed operations\n  - Custom exceptions: `ClaudeError`, `ClaudeTimeoutError`, `ClaudeRateLimitError`, `ClaudeAuthError`, `ClaudeCircuitOpenError`\n  - Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures\n  - `complete()` for generic Claude completions with system/user prompts\n  - `categorize_page()` for single page categorization with URL, title, content\n  - `categorize_pages()` for batch page categorization\n  - `ClaudeLogger` with logging for: API calls, request/response bodies, token usage, timeouts, rate limits, auth failures, circuit state changes\n  - Default categories: homepage, product, collection, blog, policy, about, contact, faq, account, cart, search, other\n  - JSON response parsing with markdown code block handling\n  - `init_claude()`, `close_claude()`, `get_claude()` for lifecycle and dependency injection\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log all outbound API calls with endpoint, method, timing ✓\n  - Log request/response bodies at DEBUG level (truncate large responses) ✓\n  - Log and handle: timeouts, rate limits (429), auth failures (401/403) ✓\n  - Include retry attempt number in logs ✓\n  - Log API quota/credit usage if available ✓ (token_usage logging)\n  - Mask API keys and tokens in all logs ✓ (key never logged, only used in header)\n  - Log circuit breaker state changes ✓\n  - All API keys via environment variables (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) ✓\n  - Handle cold-start latency ✓ (configurable timeout, default 60s)\n  - Implement request timeouts (Railway has 5min request limit) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Anthropic API uses `x-api-key` header for authentication, `anthropic-version` header for API version\n  - Response format: `{\"content\": [{\"text\": \"...\"}], \"usage\": {\"input_tokens\": N, \"output_tokens\": N}}`\n  - Claude Haiku (claude-3-haiku-20240307) is ideal for categorization: fast, cheap, good for structured output\n  - Use `temperature=0.0` for deterministic categorization results\n  - JSON parsing must handle markdown code blocks (```json...```) in responses\n  - Request ID from `response.headers.get(\"request-id\")` for debugging\n  - Retry-After header may be float for rate limits\n  - Truncate page content to ~10k chars to avoid token limits while keeping context\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.36\n- Implemented CategoryService with two-tier approach (patterns → LLM fallback)\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/services/category.py` - Full CategoryService with two-tier categorization\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Exported CategoryService and related classes\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `CategoryService` class orchestrating URLCategorizer, ContentSignalDetector, and ClaudeClient\n  - Two-tier categorization approach:\n    - Tier 1: URL pattern matching + content signal boosting (fast, free)\n    - Tier 2: LLM fallback via Claude when confidence < threshold (slower, costs tokens)\n  - `CategorizationRequest` dataclass for request input\n  - `CategorizationResult` dataclass with success, category, confidence, tier, and full analysis\n  - Custom exceptions: `CategoryServiceError`, `CategoryValidationError`, `CategoryNotFoundError`\n  - Configurable `llm_fallback_threshold` (default 0.6) to control when LLM is triggered\n  - `force_llm` and `skip_llm` parameters for fine-grained control\n  - `categorize()` for single page, `categorize_many()` for batch processing\n  - `categorize_url_only()` for quick synchronous URL-only categorization\n  - `categorize_page()` convenience function with singleton service\n  - `get_category_service()` singleton accessor\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log method entry/exit at DEBUG level with parameters (sanitized URL to 200 chars) ✓\n  - Log all exceptions with full stack trace and context via `exc_info=True` ✓\n  - Include entity IDs (project_id, page_id) in all service logs ✓\n  - Log validation failures with field names and rejected values at WARNING level ✓\n  - Log state transitions (LLM fallback triggers, category overrides) at INFO level ✓\n  - Add timing logs for operations >1 second via `SLOW_OPERATION_THRESHOLD_MS` ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Two-tier approach optimizes for speed/cost while maintaining accuracy\n  - URL pattern matching gives base confidence (0.5-0.6), content signals boost to max 0.95\n  - LLM fallback threshold of 0.6 balances accuracy vs. API costs\n  - Tier tracking ('pattern', 'llm', 'fallback') enables monitoring and cost analysis\n  - `categorize_url_only()` is useful for quick synchronous lookups without async overhead\n  - Batch categorization should process sequentially to avoid overwhelming LLM rate limits\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.37\n- Added batch processing for LLM calls (groups of 10) for efficient categorization\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Added batch logging methods to ClaudeLogger\n  - `backend/app/integrations/claude.py` - Updated `categorize_pages()` with batch processing\n  - `backend/app/services/category.py` - Updated `categorize_many()` with two-phase batch approach\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `ClaudeLogger` batch methods: `batch_start()`, `batch_complete()`, `batch_error()`, `batch_processing_start()`, `batch_processing_complete()`\n  - `ClaudeClient.categorize_pages()` now processes pages in configurable batches (default 10)\n  - `CategoryService.categorize_many()` uses two-phase approach:\n    - Phase 1: Pattern-based categorization for all pages (fast, free)\n    - Phase 2: Batch LLM calls for low-confidence pages (groups of 10)\n  - Comprehensive logging: batch start/end, tokens, success/failure counts, timing\n  - Configurable `batch_size` parameter (default 10)\n  - Per-batch error handling with fallback to pattern results\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log method entry/exit at DEBUG level with parameters (sanitized) ✓\n  - Log all exceptions with full stack trace and context via `exc_info=True` ✓\n  - Include entity IDs (project_id, page_id) in all service logs ✓\n  - Log validation failures with field names and rejected values ✓\n  - Log state transitions (phase changes) at INFO level ✓\n  - Add timing logs for operations >1 second ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Two-phase approach optimizes batch processing: pattern-first reduces LLM calls\n  - Batch size of 10 balances throughput with rate limit safety\n  - Token usage tracking per-batch enables cost monitoring\n  - Per-batch error handling prevents single failure from aborting entire job\n  - Use `exc_info=True` for full stack traces on exception logging\n---\n\n","numLines":1175,"startLine":1,"totalLines":1175}}}

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### Backend Layered Architecture\nThe backend follows a strict layered architecture pattern:\n- `app/api/` - FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n\n### Database Logging Pattern\nUse `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n\n### Configuration Pattern\nAll config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n\n### SQLite Test Fixtures Pattern\nTests use SQLite in-memory for speed. PostgreSQL types need adaptation:\n- `conftest.py` has `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function\n- UUID columns → String(36), JSONB columns → JSON\n- PostgreSQL-specific server_default values are cleared (gen_random_uuid, ::jsonb, now())\n- Use `StaticPool` with `check_same_thread=False` for SQLite async\n- Session-scoped engine, per-test session with rollback for isolation\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 -

WARNING-level logging for validation errors and not-found cases\n  - Proper error codes: VALIDATION_ERROR, NOT_FOUND, INVALID_TRANSITION\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log all incoming requests with method, path, request_id (via middleware in main.py) ✓\n  - Log request body at DEBUG level (sanitize sensitive fields) (via middleware) ✓\n  - Log response status and timing for every request (via middleware) ✓\n  - Return structured error responses: {\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str} ✓\n  - Log 4xx errors at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR ✓\n  - Include request_id in all responses (X-Request-ID header via middleware) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - FastAPI allows returning `JSONResponse` directly for error cases even when `response_model` is set\n  - Use `response_model` for success cases, return `JSONResponse` with explicit status code for errors\n  - `model_validate()` converts SQLAlchemy models to Pydantic using `from_attributes=True` config\n  - Access request_id from `request.state.request_id` set by middleware\n  - MyPy struggles with FastAPI's union return types; use `# type: ignore[return-value]` when needed\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.22\n- Implemented WebSocket endpoint for real-time project status updates\n- Files created:\n  -

Log response status and timing for every request ✓\n  - Return structured error responses: {\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str} ✓\n  - Log 4xx errors at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR ✓\n  - Include request_id in all responses for debugging ✓\n- **Railway deployment requirements met:**\n  - CORS via FRONTEND_URL env var (existing config) ✓\n  - Proper error responses with request_id ✓\n  - Background task execution for long-running crawls ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `BackgroundTasks` for fire-and-forget crawl execution (production should use Celery)\n  - Return 202 Accepted for async operations that complete in background\n  - Project ownership validation: verify crawl/page belongs to requested project_id before returning\n  - Nested router prefix pattern: `prefix=\"/projects/{project_id}/phases/crawl\"` extracts project_id from path\n  - Pydantic `ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)` enables direct SQLAlchemy model validation\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.32\n- Created comprehensive unit tests for CrawlService (URL normalization, pattern matching)\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/tests/services/test_crawl_service.py` - 85 unit tests for CrawlService\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - URL normalization tests (16 tests):\n    - Fragment removal, trailing slash handling, scheme/host lowercasing\n    - Query param sorting, tracking param removal, default port removal\n    - Error handling for empty/invalid URLs\n  - URLNormalizationOptions tests (6 tests):\n    - `strip_www`, `remove_query_params`, `keep_fragments`, `keep_trailing_slash`, `allowed_query_params`\n  - URLNormalizer.is_same_page tests (7 tests):\n    - Same page detection with fragment/trailing slash/case differences\n  - PatternMatcher tests (25 tests):\n    - Initialization with include/exclude patterns\n    - `matches_include()`, `matches_exclude()`, `should_crawl()` methods\n    - Pattern validation (empty patterns, too many wildcards)\n    - Priority determination (INCLUDE vs OTHER)\n  - Glob pattern syntax tests (5 tests):\n    - Single asterisk, double asterisk, question mark, character class, file extensions\n  - CrawlService pattern methods tests (8 tests):\n    - `create_pattern_matcher()`, `filter_urls()` with various pattern combinations\n  - Validation methods tests (12 tests):\n    - UUID validation, URL validation, crawl status validation, pagination validation\n  - Exception classes tests (5 tests):\n    - CrawlServiceError, CrawlValidationError, CrawlNotFoundError, CrawlPatternError hierarchy\n  - CrawlConfig/CrawlProgress dataclass tests (4 tests)\n- **Coverage achieved:**\n  - `app/utils/url.py`: 83% coverage\n  - `app/services/crawl.py` (URL normalization and pattern matching portions): tested\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Python's `fnmatch` uses shell-style globbing where `*` matches ANY characters including `/`, unlike pathlib's glob\n  - pytest fixtures with `@pytest.fixture` decorator cause mypy \"untyped decorator\" warnings in strict mode - this is expected behavior\n  - Tests should be organized by feature area: URL normalization, pattern matching, validation, exceptions\n  - URLNormalizationOptions provides fine-grained control: `strip_www`, `allowed_query_params`, `blocked_query_params`\n  - PatternMatcher checks exclude patterns first (precedence), then include patterns\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.33\n- Implemented URL pattern rules for categorizing crawled pages into semantic categories\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/utils/url_categorizer.py` - URLCategorizer class with CategoryRule, pattern rules, and category detection\n  - `backend/tests/utils/test_url_categorizer.py` - 70+ unit tests covering all category patterns\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/services/crawl.py` - Integrated auto-categorization into `save_crawled_page()` method\n  - `backend/app/utils/__init__.py` - Exported URLCategorizer, CategoryRule, categorize_url, get_url_categorizer, VALID_PAGE_CATEGORIES\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `CategoryRule` dataclass with regex pattern matching and priority-based ordering\n  - `URLCategorizer` class with configurable rules and default category\n  - Default pattern rules for 12 page categories:\n    - `homepage` (/, /index.html, /home) - priority 100\n    - `product` (/products/*, /product/*, /p/*, /shop/category/item) - priority 80\n    - `collection` (/collections/*, /category/*, /shop/*) - priority 70\n    - `blog` (/blog/*, /news/*, /articles/*, /posts/*) - priority 60\n    - `policy` (/privacy-policy, /terms-*, /legal/*, /refund-*, /cookie-*, /gdpr) - priority 50\n    - `about` (/about*, /company, /team, /our-story) - priority 40\n    - `contact` (/contact*, /locations, /store-locator) - priority 40\n    - `faq` (/faq, /help/*, /support/*, /kb/*) - priority 35\n    - `account` (/account, /login, /signup, /profile, /dashboard) - priority 30\n    - `cart` (/cart, /basket, /checkout) - priority 30\n    - `search` (/search*, /s?*, /find?) - priority 20\n    - `other` (default for unmatched URLs)\n  - Auto-categorization in `save_crawled_page()` with `auto_categorize=True` flag\n  - Category change logging at INFO level (state transition)\n  - Batch categorization via `categorize_many()` method\n  - `categorize_url()` convenience function with singleton instance\n  - `VALID_PAGE_CATEGORIES` frozenset for validation\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  -

Log state transitions (category changes) at INFO level ✓\n  - Add timing logs for operations >1 second via `SLOW_OPERATION_THRESHOLD_MS` ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `re.IGNORECASE` flag for case-insensitive URL matching (handles /PRODUCTS/WIDGET)\n  - Priority-based rule ordering allows fine-grained control over pattern precedence\n  - Product URLs (nested: /shop/cat/item) have higher priority than collection URLs (single: /shop/cat)\n  - Regex patterns should use `^` anchor to match from path start and `/?$` for optional trailing slash\n  - Singleton pattern via module-level `_default_categorizer` provides thread-safe reuse\n  - `frozenset` for `VALID_PAGE_CATEGORIES` ensures immutability and fast lookup\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.34\n- Implemented content signal detection for confidence boosting\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/utils/content_signals.py` - ContentSignalDetector class with signal patterns, detection, and confidence boosting\n  - `backend/tests/utils/test_content_signals.py` - 50 unit tests covering all signal detection scenarios\n- Files changed:\n  -

`ContentSignal` dataclass for detected signals (signal_type, category, confidence_boost, matched_text)\n  - `ContentAnalysis` dataclass for analysis results (url_category, url_confidence, signals, boosted_confidence, final_category)\n  - `SignalPattern` dataclass with regex patterns, priority-based ordering, and compiled pattern caching\n  - `ContentSignalDetector` class with:\n    - `detect_signals()` - Detect signals from various content types\n    - `analyze()` - Compute boosted confidence and optionally override category\n    - Pattern grouping by signal type for efficient lookup\n    - Support for multiple signals stacking (capped at max_boost=0.95)\n    - Category override when signals strongly indicate different category (min_override_boost=0.5)\n  - Default signal patterns for 12 categories: homepage, product, collection, blog, policy, about, contact, faq, account, cart, search\n  - Signal sources: title patterns, body text patterns, JSON-LD schema patterns, heading patterns, meta description, breadcrumbs\n  - `analyze_content_signals()` convenience function with singleton detector\n  - `VALID_SIGNAL_TYPES` frozenset for validation\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log method entry/exit at DEBUG level with parameters (sanitized) ✓\n  - Log all exceptions with full stack trace and context via `exc_info=True` ✓\n  - Include entity IDs (project_id, page_id) in all service logs ✓\n  - Log validation failures with field names and rejected values ✓\n  - Log state transitions (category changes/overrides) at INFO level ✓\n  - Add timing logs for operations >1 second via `SLOW_OPERATION_THRESHOLD_MS` ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Content signals complement URL-based categorization by analyzing page content\n  - Schema signals (JSON-LD @type) provide highest confidence boost (0.35-0.4)\n  - Title signals are next most reliable (0.25-0.35)\n  - Body signals are checked against first 10,000 chars for efficiency\n  - Priority-based pattern ordering allows fine-grained control over signal precedence\n  - Multiple signals for same category stack up to max_boost (0.95)\n  - Category override requires significant signal boost (min_override_boost=0.5) to prevent false overrides\n  - Use `re.IGNORECASE` for case-insensitive pattern matching\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.35\n- Created Claude/Anthropic LLM categorization client using Claude Haiku\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/integrations/claude.py` - Full Claude client with async HTTP, circuit breaker, retry logic, page categorization\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Added Claude settings (anthropic_api_key, claude_model, timeout, retries, circuit breaker)\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Added `ClaudeLogger` class with comprehensive API call logging\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - Exported Claude client and related classes\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `ClaudeClient` class with async HTTP client (httpx) directly calling Anthropic API\n  - `CircuitBreaker` class for fault tolerance (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN states)\n  - `CategorizationResult` and `CompletionResult` dataclasses for typed operations\n  - Custom exceptions: `ClaudeError`, `ClaudeTimeoutError`, `ClaudeRateLimitError`, `ClaudeAuthError`, `ClaudeCircuitOpenError`\n  - Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures\n  - `complete()` for generic Claude completions with system/user prompts\n  - `categorize_page()` for single page categorization with URL, title, content\n  - `categorize_pages()` for batch page categorization\n  - `ClaudeLogger` with logging for: API calls, request/response bodies, token usage, timeouts, rate limits, auth failures, circuit state changes\n  - Default categories: homepage, product, collection, blog, policy, about, contact, faq, account, cart, search, other\n  - JSON response parsing with markdown code block handling\n  - `init_claude()`, `close_claude()`, `get_claude()` for lifecycle and dependency injection\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log all outbound API calls with endpoint, method, timing ✓\n  - Log request/response bodies at DEBUG level (truncate large responses) ✓\n  - Log and handle: timeouts, rate limits (429), auth failures (401/403) ✓\n  - Include retry attempt number in logs ✓\n  - Log API quota/credit usage if available ✓ (token_usage logging)\n  - Mask API keys and tokens in all logs ✓ (key never logged, only used in header)\n  - Log circuit breaker state changes ✓\n  - All API keys via environment variables (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) ✓\n  - Handle cold-start latency ✓ (configurable timeout, default 60s)\n  - Implement request timeouts (Railway has 5min request limit) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Anthropic API uses `x-api-key` header for authentication, `anthropic-version` header for API version\n  - Response format: `{\"content\": [{\"text\": \"...\"}], \"usage\": {\"input_tokens\": N, \"output_tokens\": N}}`\n  - Claude Haiku (claude-3-haiku-20240307) is ideal for categorization: fast, cheap, good for structured output\n  - Use `temperature=0.0` for deterministic categorization results\n  - JSON parsing must handle markdown code blocks (```json...```) in responses\n  - Request ID from `response.headers.get(\"request-id\")` for debugging\n  - Retry-After header may be float for rate limits\n  - Truncate page content to ~10k chars to avoid token limits while keeping context\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.36\n- Implemented CategoryService with two-tier approach (patterns → LLM fallback)\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/services/category.py` - Full CategoryService with two-tier categorization\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Exported CategoryService and related classes\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `CategoryService` class orchestrating URLCategorizer, ContentSignalDetector, and ClaudeClient\n  - Two-tier categorization approach:\n    - Tier 1: URL pattern matching + content signal boosting (fast, free)\n    - Tier 2: LLM fallback via Claude when confidence < threshold (slower, costs tokens)\n  - `CategorizationRequest` dataclass for request input\n  - `CategorizationResult` dataclass with success, category, confidence, tier, and full analysis\n  - Custom exceptions: `CategoryServiceError`, `CategoryValidationError`, `CategoryNotFoundError`\n  - Configurable `llm_fallback_threshold` (default 0.6) to control when LLM is triggered\n  - `force_llm` and `skip_llm` parameters for fine-grained control\n  - `categorize()` for single page, `categorize_many()` for batch processing\n  - `categorize_url_only()` for quick synchronous URL-only categorization\n  - `categorize_page()` convenience function with singleton service\n  - `get_category_service()` singleton accessor\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log method entry/exit at DEBUG level with parameters (sanitized URL to 200 chars) ✓\n  - Log all exceptions with full stack trace and context via `exc_info=True` ✓\n  - Include entity IDs (project_id, page_id) in all service logs ✓\n  - Log validation failures with field names and rejected values at WARNING level ✓\n  - Log state transitions (LLM fallback triggers, category overrides) at INFO level ✓\n  - Add timing logs for operations >1 second via `SLOW_OPERATION_THRESHOLD_MS` ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Two-tier approach optimizes for speed/cost while maintaining accuracy\n  - URL pattern matching gives base confidence (0.5-0.6), content signals boost to max 0.95\n  - LLM fallback threshold of 0.6 balances accuracy vs. API costs\n  - Tier tracking ('pattern', 'llm', 'fallback') enables monitoring and cost analysis\n  - `categorize_url_only()` is useful for quick synchronous lookups without async overhead\n  - Batch categorization should process sequentially to avoid overwhelming LLM rate limits\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.37\n- Added batch processing for LLM calls (groups of 10) for efficient categorization\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Added batch logging methods to ClaudeLogger\n  - `backend/app/integrations/claude.py` - Updated `categorize_pages()` with batch processing\n  - `backend/app/services/category.py` - Updated `categorize_many()` with two-phase batch approach\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `ClaudeLogger` batch methods: `batch_start()`, `batch_complete()`, `batch_error()`, `batch_processing_start()`, `batch_processing_complete()`\n  - `ClaudeClient.categorize_pages()` now processes pages in configurable batches (default 10)\n  - `CategoryService.categorize_many()` uses two-phase approach:\n    - Phase 1: Pattern-based categorization for all pages (fast, free)\n    - Phase 2: Batch LLM calls for low-confidence pages (groups of 10)\n  - Comprehensive logging: batch start/end, tokens, success/failure counts, timing\n  - Configurable `batch_size` parameter (default 10)\n  - Per-batch error handling with fallback to pattern results\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log method entry/exit at DEBUG level with parameters (sanitized) ✓\n  - Log all exceptions with full stack trace and context via `exc_info=True` ✓\n  - Include entity IDs (project_id, page_id) in all service logs ✓\n  - Log validation failures with field names and rejected values ✓\n  - Log state transitions (phase changes) at INFO level ✓\n  - Add timing logs for operations >1 second ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Two-phase approach optimizes batch processing: pattern-first reduces LLM calls\n  - Batch size of 10 balances throughput with rate limit safety\n  - Token usage tracking per-batch enables cost monitoring\n  - Per-batch error handling prevents single failure from aborting entire job\n  - Use `exc_info=True` for full stack traces on exception logging\n---\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":1172,"oldLines":3,"newStart":1172,"newLines":41,"lines":["   - Use `exc_info=True` for full stack traces on exception logging"," ---"," ","+## 2026-02-01 -
