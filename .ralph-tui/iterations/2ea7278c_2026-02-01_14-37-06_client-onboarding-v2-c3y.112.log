Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### Parallel Processing with Rate Limiting\nUse `asyncio.Semaphore` with `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent operations with rate limiting:\n```python\nsemaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent)\n\nasync def process_with_semaphore(item):\n    async with semaphore:\n        return await do_work(item)\n\ntasks = [process_with_semaphore(item) for item in items]\nresults = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n```\n- For indexed results, return `(index, result)` tuples and sort after gather\n- Always wrap inner function in try/except to handle individual failures\n- Log entry/exit at DEBUG level, state transitions at INFO level\n\n### Error Logging Pattern\n- Entry/exit: DEBUG level with sanitized parameters (truncate URLs to 200 chars)\n- Exceptions: ERROR with `exc_info=True` for full stack trace\n- State transitions: INFO level (status changes, phase changes)\n- Slow operations (>1s): WARNING level with duration_ms\n- Include entity IDs (project_id, page_id, crawl_id) in all logs\n\n### FastAPI DELETE Endpoint Pattern\nFor DELETE endpoints that return 204 on success but need error responses (404, 400):\n```python\n@router.delete(\n    \"/{item_id}\",\n    response_model=None,  # Required to disable automatic response model\n    status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT,\n    responses={\n        204: {\"description\": \"Item deleted successfully\"},\n        404: {\"description\": \"Item not found\", ...},\n    },\n)\nasync def delete_item(...) -> Response | JSONResponse:\n    try:\n        await service.delete_item(item_id)\n        return Response(status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)\n    except NotFoundError as e:\n        return JSONResponse(status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND, content={...})\n```\n- Must use `response_model=None` to disable response model validation\n- Return `Response(status_code=204)` for success (not `None`)\n- Can still return `JSONResponse` for error cases\n\n### shadcn/ui Component Pattern\nWhen adding shadcn/ui components, disable the `react-refresh/only-export-components` ESLint rule:\n```tsx\n/* eslint-disable react-refresh/only-export-components */\n```\n- shadcn/ui components export both the component and its variants (e.g., `Button` and `buttonVariants`)\n- This triggers the react-refresh warning but is standard practice for shadcn/ui\n\n### shadcn/ui + Existing Tailwind Colors\nWhen integrating shadcn/ui with an existing Tailwind color palette:\n- Use `primary-ui` instead of `primary` for shadcn semantic colors to avoid conflicts\n- Add CSS variables in `:root` with HSL values (without `hsl()` wrapper)\n- Tailwind config maps to CSS variables: `\"hsl(var(--primary))\"`\n- Required colors: `border`, `input`, `ring`, `background`, `foreground`, `destructive`, `muted`, `accent`, `popover`, `card`\n\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.61\n- What was implemented: Parallel processing with rate limiting (max 5 concurrent) for CrawlService\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/services/crawl.py` - Added parallel processing to `run_crawl()` and `fetch_urls()` methods\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Existing semaphore patterns in `paa_categorization.py` and `label.py` serve as good templates\n  - For crawling with URL discovery, batch processing works well: collect batch -> process in parallel -> merge discovered URLs -> repeat\n  - Import `QueuedURL` type from crawl_queue for proper type annotations\n  - Use `MAX_CONCURRENT_CRAWLS = 5` constant for consistency\n  - Inner async functions with semaphore need proper exception handling to return error results instead of raising\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.70\n- What was implemented: Brand config endpoints at `/api/v1/projects/{id}/phases/brand_config`\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - Updated router prefix from `/brand-config` to `/phases/brand_config` to match phase endpoint convention\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/brand_config.py` - Updated docstring paths and fixed DELETE endpoint to use FastAPI-compliant pattern\n- **Learnings:**\n  - FastAPI 0.104+ enforces strict 204 No Content rules - cannot use `status_code=204` with union return types\n  - For DELETE endpoints, must use `response_model=None` and return `Response(status_code=204)` instead of `None`\n  - Phase endpoints follow pattern: `/projects/{project_id}/phases/{phase_name}`\n  - Brand config endpoints provide: synthesize (POST), list (GET), get (GET), update (PUT), delete (DELETE)\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.103\n- What was implemented: Schedule endpoints at `/api/v1/projects/{id}/phases/schedule` were already mostly complete; fixed DELETE endpoint to use FastAPI-compliant pattern\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/schedule.py` - Fixed DELETE endpoint to use `response_model=None`, import `Response`, and return `Response(status_code=204)` instead of `None`\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Schedule endpoints already existed with full CRUD operations (create, list, get, update, delete)\n  - Router was already properly registered in `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` at prefix `/projects/{project_id}/phases/schedule`\n  - Endpoints already met error logging requirements with proper structured error responses including `request_id`\n  - The DELETE endpoint pattern discovered in c3y.70 needs to be applied consistently across all endpoints\n---\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":103,"oldLines":3,"newStart":103,"newLines":22,"lines":["   - The DELETE endpoint pattern discovered in c3y.70 needs to be applied consistently across all endpoints"," ---"," ","+## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.112","+- What was implemented: shadcn/ui component library installation and configuration, verified existing error logging infrastructure","+- Files changed:","+  - `frontend/package.json` - Added dependencies: clsx, tailwind-merge, class-variance-authority, lucide-react, @radix-ui/react-slot, tailwindcss-animate","+  - `frontend/components.json` - Created shadcn/ui configuration file","+  - `frontend/src/lib/utils.ts` - Created `cn()` utility function for class merging","+  - `frontend/tailwind.config.js` - Added darkMode, container config, shadcn/ui semantic colors (border, input, ring, etc.), border-radius CSS variables, tailwindcss-animate plugin","+  - `frontend/src/index.css` - Added CSS variables for shadcn/ui theming (warm palette mapped to HSL values)","+  - `frontend/src/components/ui/button.tsx` - Added sample Button component with variants","+- **Learnings:**","+  - Error logging infrastructure was already complete: ErrorBoundary, globalErrorHandlers, errorReporting (Sentry stub), api client with error context","+  - Railway deployment config already in place: Dockerfile, nginx.conf, railway.json, VITE_API_URL env var support","+  - When adding shadcn/ui to project with existing `primary` color palette, use `primary-ui` for shadcn semantic colors","+  - CSS variables must be defined as HSL values without the `hsl()` wrapper (e.g., `--primary: 45 93% 47%;`)","+  - tailwindcss-animate plugin required for shadcn/ui animations","+  - `@apply border-border` requires `border` color to be defined in Tailwind config mapping to CSS variable","+  - npm cache permission issues can be bypassed with `--cache=/tmp/npm-cache-$USER`","+---","+"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}
