Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### Backend Layered Architecture\nThe backend follows a strict layered architecture pattern:\n- `app/api/` - FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n\n### Database Logging Pattern\nUse `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n\n### Configuration Pattern\nAll config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n\n### SQLite Test Fixtures Pattern\nTests use SQLite in-memory for speed. PostgreSQL types need adaptation:\n- `conftest.py` has `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function\n- UUID columns → String(36), JSONB columns → JSON\n- PostgreSQL-specific server_default values are cleared (gen_random_uuid, ::jsonb, now())\n- Use `StaticPool` with `check_same_thread=False` for SQLite async\n- Session-scoped engine, per-test session with rollback for isolation\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.1\n- Completed backend project structure initialization\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - SQLAlchemy models layer\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Pydantic schemas layer\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - External service clients layer\n  - `backend/app/workers/__init__.py` - Background task processing layer\n  - `backend/Procfile` -

`backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Services layer\n  - `backend/app/repositories/__init__.py` - Repositories layer\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The backend was partially initialized in a previous iteration\n  - All Railway deployment requirements were already in place (PORT binding, health endpoints, SIGTERM handling)\n  - All error logging requirements were already implemented in `app/core/logging.py`\n  - Use `python3 -m py_compile` for quick syntax verification without needing dependencies installed\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.2\n- Completed FastAPI application setup with CORS, exception handlers, and OpenAPI docs\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added request logging middleware, exception handlers, and rate limit logging\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `RequestLoggingMiddleware` - Logs all requests with method, path, request_id, timing, and status codes\n  - `sanitize_body()` - Redacts sensitive fields (password, token, secret, etc.) from request body logs\n  - Request body logging at DEBUG level for non-GET requests\n  - Structured error responses with format `{\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str}`\n  - Exception handlers for: validation errors (422), rate limits (429), and general exceptions (500)\n  - `log_rate_limit_hit()` helper function for rate limit logging at WARNING level\n  - X-Request-ID header added to all responses\n  - Log levels: 4xx at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR, success at INFO\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - CORS middleware\n  - OpenAPI docs (conditional on debug mode)\n  - /health endpoint returning `{\"status\": \"ok\"}`\n  - SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown\n  - PORT from environment variable\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `request.state.request_id` to pass request_id through the request lifecycle\n  - BaseHTTPMiddleware is the standard way to add request logging in FastAPI\n  - Exception handlers are registered with `@app.exception_handler()`\n  - Rate limit exception handler uses status code `429` directly, can be triggered by rate limiting libraries\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 -

`ProjectResponse` - Response schema with all fields and `from_attributes=True` ✓\n  - `PhaseStatusEntry` - Single phase status entry with validation ✓\n  - `PhaseStatusUpdate` - Update single phase with phase/status validation ✓\n  - `ProjectListResponse` - Paginated list with items, total, limit, offset ✓\n  - `VALID_PROJECT_STATUSES`, `VALID_PHASE_STATUSES`, `VALID_PHASES` - Validation constants ✓\n- **Validation rules verified:**\n  - Project status must be in valid set (active, completed, on_hold, cancelled, archived)\n  - Phase names must be valid (discovery, requirements, implementation, review, launch)\n  - Phase statuses must be valid (pending, in_progress, completed, blocked, skipped)\n  - Name and client_id cannot be empty/whitespace\n  - All schemas exported from `app.schemas.__init__`\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The c3y.19 bead fully implemented Project schemas - c3y.20 was redundant\n  - When beads share requirements, verify against specific checklist before implementing\n  - Always check progress.md for what was already implemented in related beads\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.21\n- Implemented /api/v1/projects endpoints with full CRUD operations\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/__init__.py` - Endpoints package marker\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/projects.py` - Projects API router with all endpoints\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - Wired up projects router\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `GET /api/v1/projects` - List projects with pagination (limit, offset)\n  - `POST /api/v1/projects` - Create a new project with validation\n  - `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}` - Get project by UUID\n  - `PUT /api/v1/projects/{project_id}` - Update project with transition validation\n  - `DELETE /api/v1/projects/{project_id}` - Delete project by UUID (204 No Content)\n  - `PATCH /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases` - Update single phase status\n  - All endpoints include request_id in structured error responses\n  - DEBUG-level request logging with sanitized parameters\n  - WARNING-level logging for validation errors and not-found cases\n  - Proper error codes: VALIDATION_ERROR, NOT_FOUND, INVALID_TRANSITION\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log all incoming requests with method, path, request_id (via middleware in main.py) ✓\n  - Log request body at DEBUG level (sanitize sensitive fields) (via middleware) ✓\n  - Log response status and timing for every request (via middleware) ✓\n  - Return structured error responses: {\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str} ✓\n  - Log 4xx errors at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR ✓\n  - Include request_id in all responses (X-Request-ID header via middleware) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - FastAPI allows returning `JSONResponse` directly for error cases even when `response_model` is set\n  - Use `response_model` for success cases, return `JSONResponse` with explicit status code for errors\n  - `model_validate()` converts SQLAlchemy models to Pydantic using `from_attributes=True` config\n  - Access request_id from `request.state.request_id` set by middleware\n  - MyPy struggles with FastAPI's union return types; use `# type: ignore[return-value]` when needed\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.22\n- Implemented WebSocket endpoint for real-time project status updates\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/core/websocket.py` - WebSocket connection manager, logger, and connection state management\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/websocket.py` - WebSocket endpoint at `/api/v1/ws/projects` with health check\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/__init__.py` - Export `connection_manager` and `ws_logger`\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - Wire up WebSocket router\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Start/stop heartbeat task in lifespan, broadcast shutdown to WebSocket clients\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `ConnectionManager` class with connection tracking by ID and project subscription\n  - `WebSocketConnection` dataclass with state tracking, subscription management, and heartbeat timestamps\n  - `WebSocketLogger` class with comprehensive logging for connections, messages, subscriptions, heartbeats\n  - Heartbeat/ping mechanism (30s interval, 90s timeout) for Railway connection keepalive\n  - Reconnection guidance in all connection/shutdown messages with exponential backoff advice\n  - Message protocol: subscribe, unsubscribe, ping, pong, project_update, shutdown, error\n  - `broadcast_project_update()` for sending updates to all subscribers of a project\n  - `broadcast_shutdown()` for graceful shutdown notification to all clients\n  - Health check endpoint at `/api/v1/ws/health` with connection count and heartbeat status\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Railway supports WebSocket connections ✓\n  - Heartbeat/ping keeps connections alive (30s interval) ✓\n  - Handle reconnection gracefully with exponential backoff advice ✓\n  - Log all incoming connections with connection_id ✓\n  - Log connection close with reason and code ✓\n  - Log message send/receive at DEBUG level ✓\n  - Log errors at ERROR level with full context ✓\n  - Log subscription changes at INFO level ✓\n  - Log heartbeat timeouts at WARNING level ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - FastAPI WebSocket uses `@router.websocket()` decorator, not `@router.get()`\n  - Use `contextlib.suppress()` instead of try/except/pass for cleaner code (ruff SIM105)\n  - Heartbeat interval should be less than Railway's idle timeout (typically 60s)\n  - WebSocket close codes: 1000 for normal, 1001 for going away, 1006 for abnormal\n  - Send reconnect_advice with `should_reconnect`, `initial_delay_ms`, `max_delay_ms`, `backoff_multiplier`\n  - Use `asyncio.Task` for background heartbeat loop, cancel on shutdown\n  - Track `last_ping` and `last_pong` timestamps per connection for timeout detection\n  - Broadcast shutdown before stopping heartbeat to give clients reconnection info\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.23\n- Created comprehensive unit tests for ProjectService achieving 83% code coverage\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/tests/services/__init__.py` - Test package marker\n  - `backend/tests/services/test_project_service.py` - 63 unit tests for ProjectService\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/tests/conftest.py` - Added SQLite type adaptation for PostgreSQL types (UUID, JSONB, server_default)\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - Test classes: TestCreateProject, TestGetProject, TestGetProjectOrNone, TestGetProjectsByClient, TestGetProjectsByStatus, TestListProjects, TestUpdateProject, TestStatusTransitions, TestUpdatePhaseStatus, TestPhaseTransitions, TestDeleteProject, TestProjectExists, TestExceptionClasses\n  - Tests cover all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)\n  - Tests cover validation logic (UUID format, status values, phase transitions)\n  - Tests cover business rules (status transitions, phase state machine)\n  - Tests cover error handling (ProjectNotFoundError, ProjectValidationError, InvalidPhaseTransitionError)\n  - Parametrized tests for status transitions (7 valid, 4 invalid)\n  - Parametrized tests for phase transitions (6 valid, 4 invalid)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - PostgreSQL-specific types (UUID, JSONB) and server_default values don't work with SQLite\n  - Need to adapt column types and clear PostgreSQL-specific server_default values for SQLite testing\n  - Use `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function to iterate over Base.metadata.tables and modify column types\n  - Pydantic schema validation happens before service-level validation, so test schema errors at schema level\n  - Session-scoped fixtures with `StaticPool` ensure consistent database state across tests\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.24\n- Created Crawl4AI integration client with async support and circuit breaker pattern\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/integrations/crawl4ai.py` - Full Crawl4AI client with async HTTP, circuit breaker, retry logic\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Added Crawl4AI settings (api_url, api_token, timeout, retries, circuit breaker)\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Added `Crawl4AILogger` class with comprehensive API call logging\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - Exported Crawl4AI client and related classes\n  - `backend/pyproject.toml` - Added httpx to mypy overrides\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `Crawl4AIClient` class with async HTTP client (httpx)\n  - `CircuitBreaker` class for fault tolerance (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN states)\n  - `CrawlResult` and `CrawlOptions` dataclasses for typed crawl operations\n  - Custom exceptions: `Crawl4AIError`, `Crawl4AITimeoutError`, `Crawl4AIRateLimitError`, `Crawl4AIAuthError`, `Crawl4AICircuitOpenError`\n  - Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures\n  - `crawl()` for single URL, `crawl_many()` for batch URLs\n  - `extract_markdown()` and `get_links()` convenience methods\n  - `health_check()` for API status\n  - `init_crawl4ai()`, `close_crawl4ai()`, `get_crawl4ai()` for lifecycle and dependency injection\n  - `Crawl4AILogger` with logging for: API calls, request/response bodies, timeouts, rate limits, auth failures, circuit state changes\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log all outbound API calls with endpoint, method, timing ✓\n  - Log request/response bodies at DEBUG level (truncate large responses) ✓\n  - Log and handle: timeouts, rate limits (429), auth failures (401/403) ✓\n  - Include retry attempt number in logs ✓\n  - Mask API keys and tokens in all logs ✓ (token never logged, only used in Authorization header)\n  - Log circuit breaker state changes ✓\n  - All API keys via environment variables (CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN) ✓\n  - Handle cold-start latency ✓ (configurable timeout, default 300s for Railway)\n  - Implement request timeouts (Railway has 5min request limit) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - httpx `AsyncClient` with `base_url` simplifies endpoint calls\n  - Use `httpx.Timeout(seconds)` for configurable timeout\n  - Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures to external APIs\n  - Truncate large response bodies in logs to avoid log bloat\n  - Use dataclasses with `field(default_factory=list)` for mutable defaults\n  - Rate limit responses may include `Retry-After` header - honor it if reasonable\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.25\n- Created URL normalization utility for canonicalizing URLs during crawling\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/utils/__init__.py` - Utils package with URL exports\n  - `backend/app/utils/url.py` - URL normalization module with `normalize_url()`, `URLNormalizer`, `URLNormalizationOptions`\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `URLNormalizationOptions` dataclass with configurable normalization behavior\n  - `URLNormalizer` class with full URL normalization logic\n  - `normalize_url()` convenience function for single URL normalization\n  - Features: fragment removal, trailing slash handling, query param sorting/filtering, default port removal, scheme/host lowercasing, www stripping\n  - Default tracking param removal (utm_*, fbclid, gclid, msclkid, ref, source)\n  - `is_same_page()` method for comparing URLs after normalization\n  - Comprehensive DEBUG-level logging for entry/exit, WARNING for validation failures\n  - Full error logging with stack traces on exceptions\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log method entry/exit at DEBUG level with parameters (sanitized) ✓\n  - Log all exceptions with full stack trace and context ✓\n  - Log validation failures with field names and rejected values ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Python's `urllib.parse` module provides `urlparse()` and `urlunparse()` for URL manipulation\n  - Use `parse_qs()` with `keep_blank_values=True` to preserve empty query params\n  - `urlencode()` with `doseq=True` handles multiple values for the same query key\n  - IPv6 addresses in URLs use bracket notation: `[::1]:8080`\n  - Default ports to remove: 80 for http, 443 for https\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.26\n- Implemented priority queue for URL crawling with priority levels (homepage=0, include=1, other=2)\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/utils/crawl_queue.py` - URLPriorityQueue class with priority-based URL ordering\n  - `backend/tests/utils/__init__.py` - Test package marker\n  - `backend/tests/utils/test_crawl_queue.py` - 53 unit tests for priority queue functionality\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/utils/__init__.py` - Exported URLPriorityQueue, URLPriority, QueuedURL, CrawlQueueLogger\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `URLPriority` enum with HOMEPAGE=0, INCLUDE=1, OTHER=2 priority levels\n  - `QueuedURL` dataclass with priority-based ordering (priority → depth → timestamp for FIFO)\n  - `URLPriorityQueue` class with heapq-based priority queue implementation\n  - `CrawlQueueLogger` class with comprehensive logging for queue operations\n  - Features: URL normalization, deduplication via seen set, include/exclude pattern matching\n  - Pattern matching using fnmatch for flexible glob patterns\n  - Same-domain filtering (only crawls URLs from start URL domain)\n  - Methods: add(), add_many(), pop(), peek(), empty(), seen_count(), has_seen(), get_stats()\n  - Queue management: clear() (keeps seen), reset() (clears all and re-adds start URL)\n  - Full iteration support via __iter__ (destructive, yields in priority order)\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log method entry/exit at DEBUG level with parameters (sanitized) ✓\n  - Log all exceptions with full stack trace and context ✓\n  - Log validation failures with field names and rejected values ✓\n  - Log state transitions (queue additions/removals) at INFO level ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `heapq` for efficient priority queue implementation in Python\n  - `dataclass(order=True)` enables automatic ordering, but `field(compare=False)` excludes fields from comparison\n  - `fnmatch` pattern `/**/` expects at least one path component before the pattern - use `/pattern/*` for direct matches\n  - Use `time.monotonic()` for FIFO timestamps instead of `time.time()` to avoid clock drift issues\n  - Exclude patterns should still mark URLs as seen to avoid re-checking\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.27\n- Implemented CrawlService with include/exclude pattern matching\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/services/crawl.py` - Full CrawlService with PatternMatcher and crawl orchestration\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Export CrawlService and related classes\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `PatternMatcher` class for URL include/exclude pattern filtering using fnmatch\n  - `CrawlConfig` and `CrawlProgress` dataclasses for crawl configuration and tracking\n  - `CrawlService` class with full crawl orchestration:\n    - `create_pattern_matcher()` - Create validated pattern matcher\n    - `filter_urls()` - Filter URL list using patterns\n    - `create_crawl_history()` / `update_crawl_status()` / `get_crawl_history()` - Crawl job management\n    - `save_crawled_page()` / `get_crawled_pages()` - Page persistence\n    - `start_crawl()` / `run_crawl()` - Crawl execution with URLPriorityQueue and Crawl4AI\n  - Custom exceptions: `CrawlServiceError`, `CrawlValidationError`, `CrawlNotFoundError`, `CrawlPatternError`\n  - Comprehensive validation: UUID format, URL format, crawl status, pagination\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log method entry/exit at DEBUG level with parameters (sanitized) ✓\n  - Log all exceptions with full stack trace and context via `exc_info=True` ✓\n  - Include entity IDs (project_id, crawl_id, page_id) in all service logs ✓\n  - Log validation failures with field names and rejected values at WARNING level ✓\n  - Log state transitions (crawl status changes) at INFO level ✓\n  - Add timing logs for operations >1 second via `SLOW_OPERATION_THRESHOLD_MS` ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - PatternMatcher should check exclude patterns first, then include patterns\n  - Use `fnmatch` for flexible glob pattern matching on URL paths\n  - Service layer orchestrates URLPriorityQueue + Crawl4AIClient + database persistence\n  - Periodic progress updates during crawl loop (every 10 pages) provide visibility\n  - Content hash via SHA256 enables change detection for crawled pages\n---\n\n","numLines":810,"startLine":1,"totalLines":810}}}

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### Backend Layered Architecture\nThe backend follows a strict layered architecture pattern:\n- `app/api/` - FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n\n### Database Logging Pattern\nUse `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n\n### Configuration Pattern\nAll config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n\n### SQLite Test Fixtures Pattern\nTests use SQLite in-memory for speed. PostgreSQL types need adaptation:\n- `conftest.py` has `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function\n- UUID columns → String(36), JSONB columns → JSON\n- PostgreSQL-specific server_default values are cleared (gen_random_uuid, ::jsonb, now())\n- Use `StaticPool` with `check_same_thread=False` for SQLite async\n- Session-scoped engine, per-test session with rollback for isolation\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.1\n- Completed backend project structure initialization\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - SQLAlchemy models layer\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Pydantic schemas layer\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - External service clients layer\n  - `backend/app/workers/__init__.py` - Background task processing layer\n  - `backend/Procfile` - Railway deployment start command\n- Files already existed (verified):\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Environment-based config\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Structured logging with all required DB logging\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Async SQLAlchemy with pool management\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - FastAPI app with health checks and SIGTERM handling\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - API router setup\n  - `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Services layer\n  - `backend/app/repositories/__init__.py` - Repositories layer\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The backend was partially initialized in a previous iteration\n  - All Railway deployment requirements were already in place (PORT binding, health endpoints, SIGTERM handling)\n  - All error logging requirements were already implemented in `app/core/logging.py`\n  - Use `python3 -m py_compile` for quick syntax verification without needing dependencies installed\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.2\n- Completed FastAPI application setup with CORS, exception handlers, and OpenAPI docs\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added request logging middleware, exception handlers, and rate limit logging\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `RequestLoggingMiddleware` - Logs all requests with method, path, request_id, timing, and status codes\n  - `sanitize_body()` - Redacts sensitive fields (password, token, secret, etc.) from request body logs\n  - Request body logging at DEBUG level for non-GET requests\n  - Structured error responses with format `{\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str}`\n  - Exception handlers for: validation errors (422), rate limits (429), and general exceptions (500)\n  - `log_rate_limit_hit()` helper function for rate limit logging at WARNING level\n  - X-Request-ID header added to all responses\n  - Log levels: 4xx at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR, success at INFO\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - CORS middleware\n  - OpenAPI docs (conditional on debug mode)\n  - /health endpoint returning `{\"status\": \"ok\"}`\n  - SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown\n  - PORT from environment variable\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `request.state.request_id` to pass request_id through the request lifecycle\n  - BaseHTTPMiddleware is the standard way to add request logging in FastAPI\n  - Exception handlers are registered with `@app.exception_handler()`\n  - Rate limit exception handler uses status code `429` directly, can be triggered by rate limiting libraries\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.3\n- Configured SQLAlchemy with async support and PostgreSQL connection\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Added SSL mode and connection timeout handling\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Added `db_connect_timeout` and `db_command_timeout` settings\n  - `backend/alembic.ini` - Created Alembic configuration for async migrations\n  - `backend/alembic/env.py` -

All required database logging (connection errors, slow queries, transaction failures, pool exhaustion)\n  - DATABASE_URL conversion from `postgres://` to `postgresql+asyncpg://`\n  - Session management with `get_session()` dependency and `transaction()` context manager\n- **Learnings:**\n  - asyncpg uses `connect_args` dict for `timeout` and `command_timeout` (not SQLAlchemy-level params)\n  - Alembic async migrations require `async_engine_from_config` and `connection.run_sync()` pattern\n  - Railway Procfile supports chained commands with `&&` for running migrations before server start\n  - SSL mode is added via URL query param, check for existing `?` to use `&` separator\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.4\n- Verified Alembic database migrations already complete (implemented in c3y.3)\n- No files changed - all requirements already satisfied\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Database connection error logging with masked connection string ✓\n  - Slow query logging (>100ms) at WARNING level ✓\n  - Transaction failure logging with rollback context ✓\n  - Migration start/end logging with version info ✓\n  - Table/model name in database error logs ✓\n  -

`alembic upgrade head` in deploy command ✓\n  - PostgreSQL only (PostgresDsn type) ✓\n  - SSL mode (sslmode=require) ✓\n  - Auto-generation support (target_metadata = Base.metadata) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The c3y.3 bead fully implemented Alembic setup including all c3y.4 requirements\n  - When beads share requirements, verify against specific checklist before implementing\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.5\n- Added Redis client with connection pooling and circuit breaker pattern\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Added Redis pool size, timeouts, and circuit breaker settings\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Added `RedisLogger` class with comprehensive logging\n  - `backend/app/core/redis.py` - Created new Redis client module (connection pooling, circuit breaker)\n  - `backend/app/core/__init__.py` - Exported Redis components\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added Redis initialization/shutdown and health check endpoint\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `CircuitBreaker` class with CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN states for fault tolerance\n  - `RedisManager` class with connection pooling via redis-py `ConnectionPool`\n  - SSL/TLS support via `rediss://` URL detection (Railway uses SSL)\n  - Connection retry logic with exponential backoff for cold starts\n  - Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable (all methods return None)\n  - Comprehensive logging: connection errors (masked URL), timeouts, circuit state changes\n  - Health check endpoint at `/health/redis` with circuit breaker state\n  - Convenience methods: get, set, delete, exists, expire, ttl, incr, decr, hash ops, list ops\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log all outbound API calls with endpoint, method, timing ✓\n  -

Connect via REDIS_URL environment variable ✓\n  - Handle Redis connection failures gracefully (cache is optional) ✓\n  - Use SSL/TLS for Redis connections in production ✓\n  - Implement connection retry logic for cold starts ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - redis-py's `ConnectionPool.from_url()` auto-detects SSL from `rediss://` scheme\n  - Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures: track failures → open circuit → wait recovery_timeout → half-open test → close on success\n  - Use `asyncio.Lock()` to protect circuit breaker state changes in async context\n  - Railway sets `REDIS_URL` with `rediss://` prefix for TLS connections\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.6\n- Created pytest configuration with fixtures for database and Redis mocking\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/tests/__init__.py` - Test package marker\n  - `backend/tests/conftest.py` - Pytest fixtures for testing\n  - `backend/tests/test_fixtures.py` - Sample tests verifying fixtures work\n- **What was implemented:**\n  -

`async_client` - Async httpx AsyncClient for async endpoint tests\n  - `mock_logger` - For testing log output\n  - `freeze_time` - Utility for freezing time in tests\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - pytest configuration in `pyproject.toml` with asyncio_mode=\"auto\"\n  - Dev dependencies including pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, aiosqlite\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `StaticPool` for SQLite to ensure same connection is reused in session scope\n  - aiosqlite requires `check_same_thread=False` in connect_args\n  - MockRedis must implement both bytes return values (like real Redis) and clear() for test isolation\n  - Use `ASGITransport` with httpx `AsyncClient` for async testing FastAPI\n  - Fixtures that mock global singletons must store/restore original state\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.7\n- Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline with lint, test, and type-check jobs\n- Files created:\n  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions CI workflow\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/pyproject.toml` - Added ruff and mypy to dev dependencies, configured both tools\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Added explicit type annotation for formatter variable\n  - `backend/app/core/redis.py` - Fixed type annotations for dict/list return types, added AsyncGenerator import\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` -

Log mock/stub invocations for debugging (DEBUG level) ✓\n  - Tests work with DATABASE_URL env var ✓\n  - Use test database, not production ✓\n  - CI mirrors Railway environment (Python 3.11, env vars) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - MyPy `ignore_missing_imports = true` doesn't prevent \"cannot subclass Any\" errors - use `disallow_subclassing_any = false` for specific modules\n  - Ruff's `--output-format=github` produces GitHub-compatible annotations for inline error display\n  - pydantic-settings and pythonjsonlogger need explicit module entries (not just `.*` patterns) in mypy overrides\n  - Use `ruff check --fix` for auto-fixable issues, then manually address remaining warnings\n  - CI jobs run in parallel by default - use `needs:` to create dependencies between jobs\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.8\n- Configured Railway deployment for staging environment\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/railway.toml` - Railway configuration with health check, nixpacks builder, and staging env vars\n  - `backend/app/deploy.py` - Deployment script with comprehensive logging (runs migrations, validates env, health checks)\n  -

`backend/app/models/__init__.py` - Export Project model\n  - `backend/alembic/env.py` - Import Project for Alembic auto-detection, fixed unused variable lint issue\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - Project model with UUID primary key using `gen_random_uuid()` server default\n  - `phase_status` JSONB field with default empty object `'{}'::jsonb` for flexible phase tracking\n  - Indexed columns: name, client_id, status for efficient queries\n  - Timestamps: created_at and updated_at with server defaults\n  - Migration creates table with proper PostgreSQL types (UUID, JSONB, TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `UUID(as_uuid=False)` to store UUIDs as strings in SQLAlchemy, avoiding UUID object serialization issues\n  - JSONB `server_default` requires `text(\"'{}'::jsonb\")` syntax, not just `text(\"{}\")`\n  - `mapped_column` with `default=dict` provides Python-side default, `server_default` provides database-side\n  - Alembic migrations should use modern Python type annotations (`str | None` vs `Union[str, None]`)\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.10\n- Created CrawledPage model with normalized_url, category, labels JSONB fields\n- Files created:\n  -

Individual indexes on project_id, normalized_url, category for queries\n- **Learnings:**\n  - For JSONB arrays, use `default=list` for Python-side and `server_default=text(\"'[]'::jsonb\")` for database-side\n  - Use `sa.ForeignKeyConstraint` in migrations for foreign keys with named constraints and `ondelete` behavior\n  - Composite unique indexes prevent duplicate URLs within the same project while allowing same URL across projects\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.11\n- Created PageKeywords model with primary/secondary keyword structure\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/page_keywords.py` - PageKeywords model with UUID PK, crawled_page_id FK, primary_keyword, secondary_keywords JSONB array\n  -

Log validation failures with field names and rejected values ✓\n  - Log state transitions (queue additions/removals) at INFO level ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `heapq` for efficient priority queue implementation in Python\n  - `dataclass(order=True)` enables automatic ordering, but `field(compare=False)` excludes fields from comparison\n  - `fnmatch` pattern `/**/` expects at least one path component before the pattern - use `/pattern/*` for direct matches\n  - Use `time.monotonic()` for FIFO timestamps instead of `time.time()` to avoid clock drift issues\n  - Exclude patterns should still mark URLs as seen to avoid re-checking\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.27\n- Implemented CrawlService with include/exclude pattern matching\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/services/crawl.py` - Full CrawlService with PatternMatcher and crawl orchestration\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Export CrawlService and related classes\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `PatternMatcher` class for URL include/exclude pattern filtering using fnmatch\n  - `CrawlConfig` and `CrawlProgress` dataclasses for crawl configuration and tracking\n  - `CrawlService` class with full crawl orchestration:\n    - `create_pattern_matcher()` - Create validated pattern matcher\n    - `filter_urls()` - Filter URL list using patterns\n    - `create_crawl_history()` / `update_crawl_status()` / `get_crawl_history()` - Crawl job management\n    - `save_crawled_page()` / `get_crawled_pages()` - Page persistence\n    - `start_crawl()` / `run_crawl()` - Crawl execution with URLPriorityQueue and Crawl4AI\n  - Custom exceptions: `CrawlServiceError`, `CrawlValidationError`, `CrawlNotFoundError`, `CrawlPatternError`\n  - Comprehensive validation: UUID format, URL format, crawl status, pagination\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log method entry/exit at DEBUG level with parameters (sanitized) ✓\n  - Log all exceptions with full stack trace and context via `exc_info=True` ✓\n  - Include entity IDs (project_id, crawl_id, page_id) in all service logs ✓\n  - Log validation failures with field names and rejected values at WARNING level ✓\n  - Log state transitions (crawl status changes) at INFO level ✓\n  - Add timing logs for operations >1 second via `SLOW_OPERATION_THRESHOLD_MS` ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - PatternMatcher should check exclude patterns first, then include patterns\n  - Use `fnmatch` for flexible glob pattern matching on URL paths\n  - Service layer orchestrates URLPriorityQueue + Crawl4AIClient + database persistence\n  - Periodic progress updates during crawl loop (every 10 pages) provide visibility\n  - Content hash via SHA256 enables change detection for crawled pages\n---\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":807,"oldLines":3,"newStart":807,"newLines":37,"lines":["   -
