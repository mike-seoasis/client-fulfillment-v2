Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### Backend Layered Architecture\nThe backend follows a strict layered architecture pattern:\n- `app/api/` - FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n\n### Database Logging Pattern\nUse `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n\n### Configuration Pattern\nAll config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n\n### SQLite Test Fixtures Pattern\nTests use SQLite in-memory for speed. PostgreSQL types need adaptation:\n- `conftest.py` has `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function\n- UUID columns → String(36), JSONB columns → JSON\n- PostgreSQL-specific server_default values are cleared (gen_random_uuid, ::jsonb, now())\n- Use `StaticPool` with `check_same_thread=False` for SQLite async\n- Session-scoped engine, per-test session with rollback for isolation\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.1\n- Completed backend project structure initialization\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - SQLAlchemy models layer\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` -

Use `python3 -m py_compile` for quick syntax verification without needing dependencies installed\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.2\n- Completed FastAPI application setup with CORS, exception handlers, and OpenAPI docs\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added request logging middleware, exception handlers, and rate limit logging\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `RequestLoggingMiddleware` - Logs all requests with method, path, request_id, timing, and status codes\n  - `sanitize_body()` - Redacts sensitive fields (password, token, secret, etc.) from request body logs\n  - Request body logging at DEBUG level for non-GET requests\n  - Structured error responses with format `{\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str}`\n  - Exception handlers for: validation errors (422), rate limits (429), and general exceptions (500)\n  - `log_rate_limit_hit()` helper function for rate limit logging at WARNING level\n  - X-Request-ID header added to all responses\n  - Log levels: 4xx at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR, success at INFO\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - CORS middleware\n  - OpenAPI docs (conditional on debug mode)\n  - /health endpoint returning `{\"status\": \"ok\"}`\n  - SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown\n  - PORT from environment variable\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `request.state.request_id` to pass request_id through the request lifecycle\n  - BaseHTTPMiddleware is the standard way to add request logging in FastAPI\n  - Exception handlers are registered with `@app.exception_handler()`\n  - Rate limit exception handler uses status code `429` directly, can be triggered by rate limiting libraries\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 -

All required database logging (connection errors, slow queries, transaction failures, pool exhaustion)\n  - DATABASE_URL conversion from `postgres://` to `postgresql+asyncpg://`\n  - Session management with `get_session()` dependency and `transaction()` context manager\n- **Learnings:**\n  - asyncpg uses `connect_args` dict for `timeout` and `command_timeout` (not SQLAlchemy-level params)\n  - Alembic async migrations require `async_engine_from_config` and `connection.run_sync()` pattern\n  - Railway Procfile supports chained commands with `&&` for running migrations before server start\n  - SSL mode is added via URL query param, check for existing `?` to use `&` separator\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 -

Connect via REDIS_URL environment variable ✓\n  - Handle Redis connection failures gracefully (cache is optional) ✓\n  - Use SSL/TLS for Redis connections in production ✓\n  - Implement connection retry logic for cold starts ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - redis-py's `ConnectionPool.from_url()` auto-detects SSL from `rediss://` scheme\n  - Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures: track failures → open circuit → wait recovery_timeout → half-open test → close on success\n  - Use `asyncio.Lock()` to protect circuit breaker state changes in async context\n  - Railway sets `REDIS_URL` with `rediss://` prefix for TLS connections\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.6\n- Created pytest configuration with fixtures for database and Redis mocking\n- Files created:\n  -

pydantic-settings and pythonjsonlogger need explicit module entries (not just `.*` patterns) in mypy overrides\n  - Use `ruff check --fix` for auto-fixable issues, then manually address remaining warnings\n  - CI jobs run in parallel by default - use `needs:` to create dependencies between jobs\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.8\n- Configured Railway deployment for staging environment\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/railway.toml` - Railway configuration with health check, nixpacks builder, and staging env vars\n  - `backend/app/deploy.py` - Deployment script with comprehensive logging (runs migrations, validates env, health checks)\n  -

`backend/app/models/__init__.py` - Export Project model\n  - `backend/alembic/env.py` - Import Project for Alembic auto-detection, fixed unused variable lint issue\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - Project model with UUID primary key using `gen_random_uuid()` server default\n  - `phase_status` JSONB field with default empty object `'{}'::jsonb` for flexible phase tracking\n  - Indexed columns: name, client_id, status for efficient queries\n  - Timestamps: created_at and updated_at with server defaults\n  - Migration creates table with proper PostgreSQL types (UUID, JSONB, TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `UUID(as_uuid=False)` to store UUIDs as strings in SQLAlchemy, avoiding UUID object serialization issues\n  - JSONB `server_default` requires `text(\"'{}'::jsonb\")` syntax, not just `text(\"{}\")`\n  - `mapped_column` with `default=dict` provides Python-side default, `server_default` provides database-side\n  - Alembic migrations should use modern Python type annotations (`str | None` vs `Union[str, None]`)\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.10\n- Created CrawledPage model with normalized_url, category, labels JSONB fields\n- Files created:\n  -

Two-tier approach optimizes for speed/cost while maintaining accuracy\n  - URL pattern matching gives base confidence (0.5-0.6), content signals boost to max 0.95\n  - LLM fallback threshold of 0.6 balances accuracy vs. API costs\n  - Tier tracking ('pattern', 'llm', 'fallback') enables monitoring and cost analysis\n  - `categorize_url_only()` is useful for quick synchronous lookups without async overhead\n  - Batch categorization should process sequentially to avoid overwhelming LLM rate limits\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.37\n- Added batch processing for LLM calls (groups of 10) for efficient categorization\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Added batch logging methods to ClaudeLogger\n  - `backend/app/integrations/claude.py` - Updated `categorize_pages()` with batch processing\n  - `backend/app/services/category.py` - Updated `categorize_many()` with two-phase batch approach\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `ClaudeLogger` batch methods: `batch_start()`, `batch_complete()`, `batch_error()`, `batch_processing_start()`, `batch_processing_complete()`\n  - `ClaudeClient.categorize_pages()` now processes pages in configurable batches (default 10)\n  - `CategoryService.categorize_many()` uses two-phase approach:\n    - Phase 1: Pattern-based categorization for all pages (fast, free)\n    - Phase 2: Batch LLM calls for low-confidence pages (groups of 10)\n  - Comprehensive logging: batch start/end, tokens, success/failure counts, timing\n  - Configurable `batch_size` parameter (default 10)\n  - Per-batch error handling with fallback to pattern results\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log method entry/exit at DEBUG level with parameters (sanitized) ✓\n  - Log all exceptions with full stack trace and context via `exc_info=True` ✓\n  - Include entity IDs (project_id, page_id) in all service logs ✓\n  - Log validation failures with field names and rejected values ✓\n  - Log state transitions (phase changes) at INFO level ✓\n  - Add timing logs for operations >1 second ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Two-phase approach optimizes batch processing: pattern-first reduces LLM calls\n  - Batch size of 10 balances throughput with rate limit safety\n  - Token usage tracking per-batch enables cost monitoring\n  - Per-batch error handling prevents single failure from aborting entire job\n  - Use `exc_info=True` for full stack traces on exception logging\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.38\n- Created /api/v1/projects/{id}/phases/categorize endpoints for page categorization\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/schemas/categorize.py` - Pydantic schemas for categorize API (CategorizeRequest, CategorizeResponse, BatchPageRequest, etc.)\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/categorize.py` - Categorize phase REST endpoints with full error logging\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - Wired up categorize router under `/projects/{project_id}/phases/categorize`\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Exported categorize schemas\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `POST /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/categorize` - Categorize a single page using two-tier approach (patterns + LLM fallback)\n  - `POST /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/categorize/batch` - Batch categorize multiple pages\n  - `POST /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/categorize/pages` - Categorize existing crawled pages by their IDs\n  - `POST /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/categorize/all` - Categorize all uncategorized pages (runs in background, returns 202)\n  - `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/categorize/stats` - Get categorization statistics (total, categorized, per-category counts)\n  - `PUT /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/categorize/pages/{page_id}` - Manually update a page's category\n  - All endpoints include request_id in structured error responses\n  - DEBUG-level request logging with sanitized parameters\n  - WARNING-level logging for validation errors and not-found cases\n  - Proper error codes: VALIDATION_ERROR, NOT_FOUND, INTERNAL_ERROR\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log all incoming requests with method, path, request_id (via middleware in main.py) ✓\n  - Log request body at DEBUG level (sanitize sensitive fields) ✓\n  - Log response status and timing for every request ✓\n  - Return structured error responses: {\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str} ✓\n  - Log 4xx errors at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR ✓\n  - Include request_id in all responses for debugging ✓\n- **Railway deployment requirements met:**\n  - CORS via FRONTEND_URL env var (existing config) ✓\n  - Proper error responses with request_id ✓\n  - Background task execution for bulk categorization ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Pydantic field name `schema_json` conflicts with a BaseModel method - use `json_ld_schema` instead\n  - Use `BackgroundTasks` for async bulk operations like `categorize/all` (returns 202 Accepted)\n  - Import ContentAnalysis from utils for proper type annotations in response conversion\n  - Nested router prefix pattern extracts project_id from path: `prefix=\"/projects/{project_id}/phases/categorize\"`\n  - Pydantic `ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)` enables direct SQLAlchemy model validation\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.39\n- Created comprehensive unit tests for pattern matching and confidence scoring in CategoryService\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/tests/services/test_category_service.py` - 58 unit tests for CategoryService\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - CategorizationRequest dataclass tests (2 tests)\n  - CategorizationResult dataclass tests (5 tests) including to_dict and content_analysis conversion\n  - CategoryService initialization tests (3 tests) for default values, custom threshold, LLM fallback settings\n  - URL validation tests (7 tests) for valid/invalid URLs, schemes, and categories\n  - URL confidence scoring tests (5 tests) verifying base confidence logic (0.6 for pattern match, 0.3 for other)\n  - Content signal boosting tests (5 tests) verifying signals boost confidence, schema signals, multiple signals stacking\n  - LLM fallback threshold tests (4 tests) for is_high_confidence, skip_llm behavior\n  - URL-only categorization tests (6 tests) for synchronous categorize_url_only method\n  - Categorize request tests (2 tests) using CategorizationRequest objects\n  - Batch categorization tests (4 tests) for categorize_many with project_id propagation\n  -

Valid categories property tests (3 tests)\n- **Coverage achieved:**\n  - CategoryService: 72% coverage (uncovered lines are mainly LLM fallback code paths)\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Test failures include full assertion context (pytest default) ✓\n  - Log test setup/teardown at DEBUG level (pytest-asyncio handles) ✓\n  - Capture and display logs from failed tests (pytest default) ✓\n  - Include timing information in test reports (pytest default) ✓\n  - Log mock/stub invocations for debugging (MagicMock used) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - CategoryService has three confidence tiers: 0.3 for 'other', 0.5 for non-pattern match, 0.6 for pattern match\n  - Content signals stack additively but cap at 0.95 (max_boost)\n  - LLM fallback threshold of 0.6 determines when Claude is called\n  - Use `skip_llm=True` in tests to avoid needing to mock the Claude client\n  - Batch categorization preserves per-request project_id if already set\n  - CategoryValidationError includes field, value, and message for detailed error context\n  - Test coverage for LLM paths would require mocking ClaudeClient.available and response\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.40\n- Implemented LabelService for generating 2-5 thematic labels per collection\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/services/label.py` - Full LabelService with two-tier labeling approach\n- Files changed:\n  -

Log state transitions (tier changes) at INFO level ✓\n  - Add timing logs for operations >1 second via `SLOW_OPERATION_THRESHOLD_MS` ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - LabelService follows same two-tier pattern as CategoryService (pattern → LLM fallback)\n  - Label normalization: lowercase, hyphen-separated, alphanumeric only\n  - Use Counter for scoring labels from multiple sources (categories, URLs, titles)\n  - Category-based labels get highest weight (3), URL patterns medium (2), title keywords lowest (1)\n  - MIN_LABELS=2 and MAX_LABELS=5 enforced with fallback to generic labels\n  - When checking `result.text` from ClaudeClient, must handle None case explicitly for type safety\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.41\n- Created LLM prompt templates for label generation\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/services/label.py` - Added LABEL_GENERATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT and LABEL_GENERATION_USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE constants, refactored _extract_llm_labels to use templates\n- **What was implemented:**\n  -

Your task is to generate 2-5 thematic labels for a collection of web pages that share common characteristics.\n\n## Label Requirements\n\nLabels should be:\n1. **Descriptive**: Capture the thematic essence of the content (e.g., \"e-commerce\", \"educational\", \"seasonal-promotions\")\n2. **Format**: Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens, e.g., \"product-focused\", \"lead-generation\")\n3. **Length**: Between 2-50 characters each\n4. **Unique**: No duplicate or redundant labels\n5. **Relevant**: Directly applicable to the page collection\n\n## Valid Label Categories\n\nConsider labels from these dimensions:\n- **Content Type**: e-commerce, blog-content, educational, informational, transactional\n- **User Intent**: lead-generation, customer-support, brand-awareness, conversion-focused\n- **Temporal**: seasonal, evergreen, trending, time-sensitive\n- **Audience**: consumer, enterprise, developer, beginner-friendly\n- **Industry**: retail, technology, healthcare, finance, travel\n- **Page Function**: catalog, landing-page, support, checkout, account-management\n\n## Response Format\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure (no markdown, no explanation):\n{\n    \"labels\": [\"label-1\", \"label-2\", \"label-3\"],\n    \"confidence\": 0.85,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of why these labels were chosen (1-2 sentences)\"\n}\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Generate between 2-5 labels (minimum 2, maximum 5)\n- Confidence score: 0.0 = uncertain, 1.0 = highly certain\n- If pages are diverse with no clear theme, use broader labels with lower confidence\n- Prioritize specificity over generality when content allows\n- Avoid overly generic labels like \"web\" or \"content\" unless truly applicable\"\"\"\n\nLABEL_GENERATION_USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = \"\"\"Analyze this collection of {page_count} web pages and generate 2-5 thematic labels.\n\n## Page Collection Summary\n\n**Category Breakdown**: {category_summary}\n\n**Sample URLs**:\n{sample_urls}\n\n**Sample Page Titles**:\n{sample_titles}\n{sample_content}\n## Instructions\n\n1. Identify common themes across the pages\n2. Generate 2-5 descriptive labels in kebab-case format\n3. Assign a confidence score based on how well the labels capture the collection's essence\n4.
