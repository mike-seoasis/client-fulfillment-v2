PostgreSQL types need adaptation:\n- `conftest.py` has `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function\n- UUID columns → String(36), JSONB columns → JSON\n- PostgreSQL-specific server_default values are cleared (gen_random_uuid, ::jsonb, now())\n- Use `StaticPool` with `check_same_thread=False` for SQLite async\n- Session-scoped engine, per-test session with rollback for isolation\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.1\n- Completed backend project structure initialization\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - SQLAlchemy models layer\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Pydantic schemas layer\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - External service clients layer\n  - `backend/app/workers/__init__.py` - Background task processing layer\n  - `backend/Procfile` - Railway deployment start command\n- Files already existed (verified):\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Environment-based config\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Structured logging with all required DB logging\n  -

`backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Services layer\n  - `backend/app/repositories/__init__.py` - Repositories layer\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The backend was partially initialized in a previous iteration\n  - All Railway deployment requirements were already in place (PORT binding, health endpoints, SIGTERM handling)\n  - All error logging requirements were already implemented in `app/core/logging.py`\n  - Use `python3 -m py_compile` for quick syntax verification without needing dependencies installed\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.2\n- Completed FastAPI application setup with CORS, exception handlers, and OpenAPI docs\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added request logging middleware, exception handlers, and rate limit logging\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `RequestLoggingMiddleware` - Logs all requests with method, path, request_id, timing, and status codes\n  - `sanitize_body()` - Redacts sensitive fields (password, token, secret, etc.) from request body logs\n  - Request body logging at DEBUG level for non-GET requests\n  - Structured error responses with format `{\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str}`\n  - Exception handlers for: validation errors (422), rate limits (429), and general exceptions (500)\n  - `log_rate_limit_hit()` helper function for rate limit logging at WARNING level\n  - X-Request-ID header added to all responses\n  - Log levels: 4xx at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR, success at INFO\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - CORS middleware\n  - OpenAPI docs (conditional on debug mode)\n  - /health endpoint returning `{\"status\": \"ok\"}`\n  - SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown\n  - PORT from environment variable\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `request.state.request_id` to pass request_id through the request lifecycle\n  - BaseHTTPMiddleware is the standard way to add request logging in FastAPI\n  - Exception handlers are registered with `@app.exception_handler()`\n  - Rate limit exception handler uses status code `429` directly, can be triggered by rate limiting libraries\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 -

All required database logging (connection errors, slow queries, transaction failures, pool exhaustion)\n  - DATABASE_URL conversion from `postgres://` to `postgresql+asyncpg://`\n  - Session management with `get_session()` dependency and `transaction()` context manager\n- **Learnings:**\n  - asyncpg uses `connect_args` dict for `timeout` and `command_timeout` (not SQLAlchemy-level params)\n  - Alembic async migrations require `async_engine_from_config` and `connection.run_sync()` pattern\n  - Railway Procfile supports chained commands with `&&` for running migrations before server start\n  - SSL mode is added via URL query param, check for existing `?` to use `&` separator\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 -

redis-py's `ConnectionPool.from_url()` auto-detects SSL from `rediss://` scheme\n  - Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures: track failures → open circuit → wait recovery_timeout → half-open test → close on success\n  - Use `asyncio.Lock()` to protect circuit breaker state changes in async context\n  - Railway sets `REDIS_URL` with `rediss://` prefix for TLS connections\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.6\n- Created pytest configuration with fixtures for database and Redis mocking\n- Files created:\n  -

MyPy `ignore_missing_imports = true` doesn't prevent \"cannot subclass Any\" errors - use `disallow_subclassing_any = false` for specific modules\n  - Ruff's `--output-format=github` produces GitHub-compatible annotations for inline error display\n  - pydantic-settings and pythonjsonlogger need explicit module entries (not just `.*` patterns) in mypy overrides\n  - Use `ruff check --fix` for auto-fixable issues, then manually address remaining warnings\n  - CI jobs run in parallel by default - use `needs:` to create dependencies between jobs\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.8\n- Configured Railway deployment for staging environment\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/railway.toml` - Railway configuration with health check, nixpacks builder, and staging env vars\n  - `backend/app/deploy.py` - Deployment script with comprehensive logging (runs migrations, validates env, health checks)\n  -

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### Backend Layered Architecture\nThe backend follows a strict layered architecture pattern:\n- `app/api/` - FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n\n### Database Logging Pattern\nUse `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n\n### Configuration Pattern\nAll config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n\n### SQLite Test Fixtures Pattern\nTests use SQLite in-memory for speed. PostgreSQL types need adaptation:\n- `conftest.py` has `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function\n- UUID columns → String(36), JSONB columns → JSON\n- PostgreSQL-specific server_default values are cleared (gen_random_uuid, ::jsonb, now())\n- Use `StaticPool` with `check_same_thread=False` for SQLite async\n- Session-scoped engine, per-test session with rollback for isolation\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.1\n- Completed backend project structure initialization\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - SQLAlchemy models layer\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Pydantic schemas layer\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - External service clients layer\n  - `backend/app/workers/__init__.py` - Background task processing layer\n  - `backend/Procfile` -

WARNING-level logging for validation errors and not-found cases\n  - Proper error codes: VALIDATION_ERROR, NOT_FOUND, INVALID_TRANSITION\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log all incoming requests with method, path, request_id (via middleware in main.py) ✓\n  - Log request body at DEBUG level (sanitize sensitive fields) (via middleware) ✓\n  - Log response status and timing for every request (via middleware) ✓\n  - Return structured error responses: {\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str} ✓\n  - Log 4xx errors at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR ✓\n  - Include request_id in all responses (X-Request-ID header via middleware) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - FastAPI allows returning `JSONResponse` directly for error cases even when `response_model` is set\n  - Use `response_model` for success cases, return `JSONResponse` with explicit status code for errors\n  - `model_validate()` converts SQLAlchemy models to Pydantic using `from_attributes=True` config\n  - Access request_id from `request.state.request_id` set by middleware\n  - MyPy struggles with FastAPI's union return types; use `# type: ignore[return-value]` when needed\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.22\n- Implemented WebSocket endpoint for real-time project status updates\n- Files created:\n  -
