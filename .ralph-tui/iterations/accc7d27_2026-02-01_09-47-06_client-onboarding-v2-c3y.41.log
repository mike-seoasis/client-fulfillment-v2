Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### Backend Layered Architecture\nThe backend follows a strict layered architecture pattern:\n- `app/api/` - FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n\n### Database Logging Pattern\nUse `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n\n### Configuration Pattern\nAll config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n\n### SQLite Test Fixtures Pattern\nTests use SQLite in-memory for speed. PostgreSQL types need adaptation:\n- `conftest.py` has `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function\n- UUID columns → String(36), JSONB columns → JSON\n- PostgreSQL-specific server_default values are cleared (gen_random_uuid, ::jsonb, now())\n- Use `StaticPool` with `check_same_thread=False` for SQLite async\n- Session-scoped engine, per-test session with rollback for isolation\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.1\n- Completed backend project structure initialization\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - SQLAlchemy models layer\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Pydantic schemas layer\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - External service clients layer\n  - `backend/app/workers/__init__.py` - Background task processing layer\n  - `backend/Procfile` -

`backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Services layer\n  - `backend/app/repositories/__init__.py` - Repositories layer\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The backend was partially initialized in a previous iteration\n  - All Railway deployment requirements were already in place (PORT binding, health endpoints, SIGTERM handling)\n  - All error logging requirements were already implemented in `app/core/logging.py`\n  - Use `python3 -m py_compile` for quick syntax verification without needing dependencies installed\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.2\n- Completed FastAPI application setup with CORS, exception handlers, and OpenAPI docs\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added request logging middleware, exception handlers, and rate limit logging\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `RequestLoggingMiddleware` - Logs all requests with method, path, request_id, timing, and status codes\n  - `sanitize_body()` - Redacts sensitive fields (password, token, secret, etc.) from request body logs\n  - Request body logging at DEBUG level for non-GET requests\n  - Structured error responses with format `{\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str}`\n  - Exception handlers for: validation errors (422), rate limits (429), and general exceptions (500)\n  - `log_rate_limit_hit()` helper function for rate limit logging at WARNING level\n  - X-Request-ID header added to all responses\n  - Log levels: 4xx at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR, success at INFO\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - CORS middleware\n  - OpenAPI docs (conditional on debug mode)\n  - /health endpoint returning `{\"status\": \"ok\"}`\n  - SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown\n  - PORT from environment variable\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `request.state.request_id` to pass request_id through the request lifecycle\n  - BaseHTTPMiddleware is the standard way to add request logging in FastAPI\n  - Exception handlers are registered with `@app.exception_handler()`\n  - Rate limit exception handler uses status code `429` directly, can be triggered by rate limiting libraries\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 -

All required database logging (connection errors, slow queries, transaction failures, pool exhaustion)\n  - DATABASE_URL conversion from `postgres://` to `postgresql+asyncpg://`\n  - Session management with `get_session()` dependency and `transaction()` context manager\n- **Learnings:**\n  - asyncpg uses `connect_args` dict for `timeout` and `command_timeout` (not SQLAlchemy-level params)\n  - Alembic async migrations require `async_engine_from_config` and `connection.run_sync()` pattern\n  - Railway Procfile supports chained commands with `&&` for running migrations before server start\n  - SSL mode is added via URL query param, check for existing `?` to use `&` separator\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 -

Created new Redis client module (connection pooling, circuit breaker)\n  - `backend/app/core/__init__.py` - Exported Redis components\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added Redis initialization/shutdown and health check endpoint\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `CircuitBreaker` class with CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN states for fault tolerance\n  - `RedisManager` class with connection pooling via redis-py `ConnectionPool`\n  - SSL/TLS support via `rediss://` URL detection (Railway uses SSL)\n  - Connection retry logic with exponential backoff for cold starts\n  - Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable (all methods return None)\n  - Comprehensive logging: connection errors (masked URL), timeouts, circuit state changes\n  -

Connect via REDIS_URL environment variable ✓\n  - Handle Redis connection failures gracefully (cache is optional) ✓\n  - Use SSL/TLS for Redis connections in production ✓\n  - Implement connection retry logic for cold starts ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - redis-py's `ConnectionPool.from_url()` auto-detects SSL from `rediss://` scheme\n  - Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures: track failures → open circuit → wait recovery_timeout → half-open test → close on success\n  - Use `asyncio.Lock()` to protect circuit breaker state changes in async context\n  - Railway sets `REDIS_URL` with `rediss://` prefix for TLS connections\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.6\n- Created pytest configuration with fixtures for database and Redis mocking\n- Files created:\n  -

pytest configuration in `pyproject.toml` with asyncio_mode=\"auto\"\n  - Dev dependencies including pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, aiosqlite\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `StaticPool` for SQLite to ensure same connection is reused in session scope\n  - aiosqlite requires `check_same_thread=False` in connect_args\n  - MockRedis must implement both bytes return values (like real Redis) and clear() for test isolation\n  - Use `ASGITransport` with httpx `AsyncClient` for async testing FastAPI\n  - Fixtures that mock global singletons must store/restore original state\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.7\n- Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline with lint, test, and type-check jobs\n- Files created:\n  -

Log mock/stub invocations for debugging (DEBUG level) ✓\n  - Tests work with DATABASE_URL env var ✓\n  - Use test database, not production ✓\n  - CI mirrors Railway environment (Python 3.11, env vars) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - MyPy `ignore_missing_imports = true` doesn't prevent \"cannot subclass Any\" errors - use `disallow_subclassing_any = false` for specific modules\n  - Ruff's `--output-format=github` produces GitHub-compatible annotations for inline error display\n  - pydantic-settings and pythonjsonlogger need explicit module entries (not just `.*` patterns) in mypy overrides\n  - Use `ruff check --fix` for auto-fixable issues, then manually address remaining warnings\n  - CI jobs run in parallel by default - use `needs:` to create dependencies between jobs\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.8\n- Configured Railway deployment for staging environment\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/railway.toml` - Railway configuration with health check, nixpacks builder, and staging env vars\n  - `backend/app/deploy.py` - Deployment script with comprehensive logging (runs migrations, validates env, health checks)\n  -

`phase_status` JSONB field with default empty object `'{}'::jsonb` for flexible phase tracking\n  - Indexed columns: name, client_id, status for efficient queries\n  - Timestamps: created_at and updated_at with server defaults\n  - Migration creates table with proper PostgreSQL types (UUID, JSONB, TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `UUID(as_uuid=False)` to store UUIDs as strings in SQLAlchemy, avoiding UUID object serialization issues\n  - JSONB `server_default` requires `text(\"'{}'::jsonb\")` syntax, not just `text(\"{}\")`\n  - `mapped_column` with `default=dict` provides Python-side default, `server_default` provides database-side\n  - Alembic migrations should use modern Python type annotations (`str | None` vs `Union[str, None]`)\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.10\n- Created CrawledPage model with normalized_url, category, labels JSONB fields\n- Files created:\n  -

Individual indexes on project_id, normalized_url, category for queries\n- **Learnings:**\n  - For JSONB arrays, use `default=list` for Python-side and `server_default=text(\"'[]'::jsonb\")` for database-side\n  - Use `sa.ForeignKeyConstraint` in migrations for foreign keys with named constraints and `ondelete` behavior\n  - Composite unique indexes prevent duplicate URLs within the same project while allowing same URL across projects\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 -

`CrawlQueueLogger` class with comprehensive logging for queue operations\n  - Features: URL normalization, deduplication via seen set, include/exclude pattern matching\n  - Pattern matching using fnmatch for flexible glob patterns\n  - Same-domain filtering (only crawls URLs from start URL domain)\n  - Methods: add(), add_many(), pop(), peek(), empty(), seen_count(), has_seen(), get_stats()\n  - Queue management: clear() (keeps seen), reset() (clears all and re-adds start URL)\n  - Full iteration support via __iter__ (destructive, yields in priority order)\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log method entry/exit at DEBUG level with parameters (sanitized) ✓\n  - Log all exceptions with full stack trace and context ✓\n  - Log validation failures with field names and rejected values ✓\n  - Log state transitions (queue additions/removals) at INFO level ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `heapq` for efficient priority queue implementation in Python\n  - `dataclass(order=True)` enables automatic ordering, but `field(compare=False)` excludes fields from comparison\n  - `fnmatch` pattern `/**/` expects at least one path component before the pattern - use `/pattern/*` for direct matches\n  - Use `time.monotonic()` for FIFO timestamps instead of `time.time()` to avoid clock drift issues\n  - Exclude patterns should still mark URLs as seen to avoid re-checking\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.27\n- Implemented CrawlService with include/exclude pattern matching\n- Files created:\n  -

Python's `fnmatch` uses shell-style globbing where `*` matches ANY characters including `/`, unlike pathlib's glob\n  - pytest fixtures with `@pytest.fixture` decorator cause mypy \"untyped decorator\" warnings in strict mode - this is expected behavior\n  - Tests should be organized by feature area: URL normalization, pattern matching, validation, exceptions\n  - URLNormalizationOptions provides fine-grained control: `strip_www`, `allowed_query_params`, `blocked_query_params`\n  - PatternMatcher checks exclude patterns first (precedence), then include patterns\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.33\n- Implemented URL pattern rules for categorizing crawled pages into semantic categories\n- Files created:\n  -

`backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - Wired up categorize router under `/projects/{project_id}/phases/categorize`\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Exported categorize schemas\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `POST /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/categorize` - Categorize a single page using two-tier approach (patterns + LLM fallback)\n  - `POST /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/categorize/batch` - Batch categorize multiple pages\n  - `POST /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/categorize/pages` - Categorize existing crawled pages by their IDs\n  - `POST /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/categorize/all` - Categorize all uncategorized pages (runs in background, returns 202)\n  - `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/categorize/stats` - Get categorization statistics (total, categorized, per-category counts)\n  - `PUT /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/phases/categorize/pages/{page_id}` - Manually update a page's category\n  - All endpoints include request_id in structured error responses\n  - DEBUG-level request logging with sanitized parameters\n  - WARNING-level logging for validation errors and not-found cases\n  - Proper error codes: VALIDATION_ERROR, NOT_FOUND, INTERNAL_ERROR\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log all incoming requests with method, path, request_id (via middleware in main.py) ✓\n  - Log request body at DEBUG level (sanitize sensitive fields) ✓\n  - Log response status and timing for every request ✓\n  - Return structured error responses: {\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str} ✓\n  - Log 4xx errors at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR ✓\n  - Include request_id in all responses for debugging ✓\n- **Railway deployment requirements met:**\n  - CORS via FRONTEND_URL env var (existing config) ✓\n  - Proper error responses with request_id ✓\n  - Background task execution for bulk categorization ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Pydantic field name `schema_json` conflicts with a BaseModel method - use `json_ld_schema` instead\n  - Use `BackgroundTasks` for async bulk operations like `categorize/all` (returns 202 Accepted)\n  - Import ContentAnalysis from utils for proper type annotations in response conversion\n  - Nested router prefix pattern extracts project_id from path: `prefix=\"/projects/{project_id}/phases/categorize\"`\n  - Pydantic `ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)` enables direct SQLAlchemy model validation\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.39\n- Created comprehensive unit tests for pattern matching and confidence scoring in CategoryService\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/tests/services/test_category_service.py` - 58 unit tests for CategoryService\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - CategorizationRequest dataclass tests (2 tests)\n  - CategorizationResult dataclass tests (5 tests) including to_dict and content_analysis conversion\n  - CategoryService initialization tests (3 tests) for default values, custom threshold, LLM fallback settings\n  - URL validation tests (7 tests) for valid/invalid URLs, schemes, and categories\n  - URL confidence scoring tests (5 tests) verifying base confidence logic (0.6 for pattern match, 0.3 for other)\n  - Content signal boosting tests (5 tests) verifying signals boost confidence, schema signals, multiple signals stacking\n  - LLM fallback threshold tests (4 tests) for is_high_confidence, skip_llm behavior\n  - URL-only categorization tests (6 tests) for synchronous categorize_url_only method\n  - Categorize request tests (2 tests) using CategorizationRequest objects\n  - Batch categorization tests (4 tests) for categorize_many with project_id propagation\n  - Error handling tests (2 tests) for validation errors\n  - Exception classes tests (4 tests) for exception hierarchy\n  - Singleton and convenience function tests (2 tests)\n  - Timing and tier assignment tests (4 tests)\n  - Valid categories property tests (3 tests)\n- **Coverage achieved:**\n  - CategoryService: 72% coverage (uncovered lines are mainly LLM fallback code paths)\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Test failures include full assertion context (pytest default) ✓\n  - Log test setup/teardown at DEBUG level (pytest-asyncio handles) ✓\n  - Capture and display logs from failed tests (pytest default) ✓\n  - Include timing information in test reports (pytest default) ✓\n  - Log mock/stub invocations for debugging (MagicMock used) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - CategoryService has three confidence tiers: 0.3 for 'other', 0.5 for non-pattern match, 0.6 for pattern match\n  - Content signals stack additively but cap at 0.95 (max_boost)\n  - LLM fallback threshold of 0.6 determines when Claude is called\n  - Use `skip_llm=True` in tests to avoid needing to mock the Claude client\n  - Batch categorization preserves per-request project_id if already set\n  - CategoryValidationError includes field, value, and message for detailed error context\n  - Test coverage for LLM paths would require mocking ClaudeClient.available and response\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.40\n- Implemented LabelService for generating 2-5 thematic labels per collection\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/services/label.py` - Full LabelService with two-tier labeling approach\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Exported LabelService and related classes\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `LabelService` class with two-tier labeling approach (patterns + LLM fallback)\n  - `LabelRequest` and `LabelResult` dataclasses for typed operations\n  - Custom exceptions: `LabelServiceError`, `LabelValidationError`, `LabelGenerationError`\n  - Pattern-based labeling from categories, URLs, and title keywords\n  - LLM-based labeling via Claude when pattern confidence is below threshold\n  - Label validation and normalization (2-50 chars, kebab-case)\n  - Configurable `llm_fallback_threshold` (default 0.5)\n  - `generate_labels()` for async labeling, `generate_labels_sync()` for pattern-only sync\n  - `get_label_service()` singleton accessor\n  - `generate_collection_labels()` convenience function\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log method entry/exit at DEBUG level with parameters (sanitized) ✓\n  - Log all exceptions with full stack trace and context via `exc_info=True` ✓\n  - Include entity IDs (project_id, page_id) in all service logs ✓\n  - Log validation failures with field names and rejected values at WARNING level ✓\n  - Log state transitions (tier changes) at INFO level ✓\n  - Add timing logs for operations >1 second via `SLOW_OPERATION_THRESHOLD_MS` ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - LabelService follows same two-tier pattern as CategoryService (pattern → LLM fallback)\n  - Label normalization: lowercase, hyphen-separated, alphanumeric only\n  - Use Counter for scoring labels from multiple sources (categories, URLs, titles)\n  - Category-based labels get highest weight (3), URL patterns medium (2), title keywords lowest (1)\n  - MIN_LABELS=2 and MAX_LABELS=5 enforced with fallback to generic labels\n  - When checking `result.text` from ClaudeClient, must handle None case explicitly for type safety\n---\n\n","numLines":1284,"startLine":1,"totalLines":1284}}}

Provide brief reasoning for your label choices\n\nRespond with JSON only.\"\"\"\n\n# Default themes for pattern-based labeling\nDEFAULT_THEMES = frozenset({\n    \"primary-nav\",\n    \"secondary-nav\",\n    \"footer\",\n    \"high-traffic\",\n    \"low-traffic\",\n    \"needs-review\",\n    \"optimized\",\n    \"conversion-focused\",\n    \"informational\",\n    \"transactional\",\n    \"educational\",\n    \"promotional\",\n    \"seasonal\",\n    \"evergreen\",\n})\n\n\nclass LabelServiceError(Exception):\n    \"\"\"Base exception for LabelService errors.\"\"\"\n\n    pass\n\n\nclass LabelValidationError(LabelServiceError):\n    \"\"\"Raised when label validation fails.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, field: str, value: Any, message: str):\n        self.field = field\n        self.value = value\n        self.message = message\n        super().__init__(f\"Validation failed for '{field}': {message}\")\n\n\nclass LabelGenerationError(LabelServiceError):\n    \"\"\"Raised when label generation fails.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, message: str, project_id: str | None = None):\n        self.project_id = project_id\n        super().__init__(message)\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass LabelRequest:\n    \"\"\"Request for label generation.\n\n    Attributes:\n        urls: List of URLs in the collection\n        titles: List of page titles\n        categories: List of page categories\n        content_snippets: Optional list of content snippets (first 500 chars)\n        project_id: Project ID for logging\n    \"\"\"\n\n    urls: list[str]\n    titles: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)\n    categories: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)\n    content_snippets: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)\n    project_id: str | None = None\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass LabelResult:\n    \"\"\"Result of label generation.\n\n    Attributes:\n        success: Whether label generation succeeded\n        labels: Generated labels (2-5 thematic labels)\n        confidence: Confidence score (0.0 to 1.0)\n        tier: Which tier was used ('pattern', 'llm', 'fallback')\n        reasoning: LLM reasoning for label selection (if applicable)\n        pattern_labels: Labels from pattern matching\n        llm_labels: Labels from LLM (if used)\n        error: Error message if failed\n        duration_ms: Total time taken\n        project_id: Project ID (for logging context)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    success: bool\n    labels: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)\n    confidence: float = 0.0\n    tier: str = \"pattern\"  # 'pattern', 'llm', 'fallback'\n    reasoning: str | None = None\n    pattern_labels: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)\n    llm_labels: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)\n    error: str | None = None\n    duration_ms: float = 0.0\n    project_id: str | None = None\n\n    def to_dict(self) -> dict[str, Any]:\n        \"\"\"Convert result to dictionary for serialization.\"\"\"\n        return {\n            \"success\": self.success,\n            \"labels\": self.labels,\n            \"confidence\": self.confidence,\n            \"tier\": self.tier,\n            \"reasoning\": self.reasoning,\n            \"pattern_labels\": self.pattern_labels,\n            \"llm_labels\": self.llm_labels,\n            \"error\": self.error,\n            \"duration_ms\": self.duration_ms,\n        }\n\n\nclass LabelService:\n    \"\"\"Service for generating thematic labels for page collections.\n\n    Uses a two-tier approach:\n    1.

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### Backend Layered Architecture\nThe backend follows a strict layered architecture pattern:\n- `app/api/` - FastAPI routers and endpoints (entry points)\n- `app/services/` - Business logic orchestration\n- `app/repositories/` - Data access layer (SQLAlchemy)\n- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic validation models\n- `app/integrations/` - External API clients\n- `app/workers/` - Background job processing\n- `app/core/` - Shared infrastructure (config, logging, database)\n\n### Database Logging Pattern\nUse `db_logger` from `app.core.logging` for all database-related logging:\n- `db_logger.connection_error()` - with masked connection string\n- `db_logger.slow_query()` - for queries >100ms (WARNING level)\n- `db_logger.transaction_failure()` - with rollback context\n- `db_logger.pool_exhausted()` - at CRITICAL level\n\n### Configuration Pattern\nAll config via environment variables using `pydantic-settings`:\n- `get_settings()` returns cached Settings instance\n- PORT is set by Railway dynamically\n- DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL for connection strings\n\n### SQLite Test Fixtures Pattern\nTests use SQLite in-memory for speed. PostgreSQL types need adaptation:\n- `conftest.py` has `_adapt_postgres_types_for_sqlite()` function\n- UUID columns → String(36), JSONB columns → JSON\n- PostgreSQL-specific server_default values are cleared (gen_random_uuid, ::jsonb, now())\n- Use `StaticPool` with `check_same_thread=False` for SQLite async\n- Session-scoped engine, per-test session with rollback for isolation\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.1\n- Completed backend project structure initialization\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - SQLAlchemy models layer\n  - `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` - Pydantic schemas layer\n  - `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - External service clients layer\n  - `backend/app/workers/__init__.py` - Background task processing layer\n  - `backend/Procfile` - Railway deployment start command\n- Files already existed (verified):\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Environment-based config\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Structured logging with all required DB logging\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Async SQLAlchemy with pool management\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - FastAPI app with health checks and SIGTERM handling\n  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - API router setup\n  - `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Services layer\n  - `backend/app/repositories/__init__.py` - Repositories layer\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The backend was partially initialized in a previous iteration\n  - All Railway deployment requirements were already in place (PORT binding, health endpoints, SIGTERM handling)\n  - All error logging requirements were already implemented in `app/core/logging.py`\n  - Use `python3 -m py_compile` for quick syntax verification without needing dependencies installed\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.2\n- Completed FastAPI application setup with CORS, exception handlers, and OpenAPI docs\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added request logging middleware, exception handlers, and rate limit logging\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `RequestLoggingMiddleware` - Logs all requests with method, path, request_id, timing, and status codes\n  - `sanitize_body()` - Redacts sensitive fields (password, token, secret, etc.) from request body logs\n  - Request body logging at DEBUG level for non-GET requests\n  - Structured error responses with format `{\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str}`\n  - Exception handlers for: validation errors (422), rate limits (429), and general exceptions (500)\n  - `log_rate_limit_hit()` helper function for rate limit logging at WARNING level\n  - X-Request-ID header added to all responses\n  - Log levels: 4xx at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR, success at INFO\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - CORS middleware\n  - OpenAPI docs (conditional on debug mode)\n  - /health endpoint returning `{\"status\": \"ok\"}`\n  - SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown\n  - PORT from environment variable\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `request.state.request_id` to pass request_id through the request lifecycle\n  - BaseHTTPMiddleware is the standard way to add request logging in FastAPI\n  - Exception handlers are registered with `@app.exception_handler()`\n  - Rate limit exception handler uses status code `429` directly, can be triggered by rate limiting libraries\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.3\n- Configured SQLAlchemy with async support and PostgreSQL connection\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` - Added SSL mode and connection timeout handling\n  -

All required database logging (connection errors, slow queries, transaction failures, pool exhaustion)\n  - DATABASE_URL conversion from `postgres://` to `postgresql+asyncpg://`\n  - Session management with `get_session()` dependency and `transaction()` context manager\n- **Learnings:**\n  - asyncpg uses `connect_args` dict for `timeout` and `command_timeout` (not SQLAlchemy-level params)\n  - Alembic async migrations require `async_engine_from_config` and `connection.run_sync()` pattern\n  - Railway Procfile supports chained commands with `&&` for running migrations before server start\n  - SSL mode is added via URL query param, check for existing `?` to use `&` separator\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.4\n- Verified Alembic database migrations already complete (implemented in c3y.3)\n- No files changed - all requirements already satisfied\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Database connection error logging with masked connection string ✓\n  - Slow query logging (>100ms) at WARNING level ✓\n  - Transaction failure logging with rollback context ✓\n  - Migration start/end logging with version info ✓\n  - Table/model name in database error logs ✓\n  -

`alembic upgrade head` in deploy command ✓\n  - PostgreSQL only (PostgresDsn type) ✓\n  - SSL mode (sslmode=require) ✓\n  - Auto-generation support (target_metadata = Base.metadata) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The c3y.3 bead fully implemented Alembic setup including all c3y.4 requirements\n  - When beads share requirements, verify against specific checklist before implementing\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.5\n- Added Redis client with connection pooling and circuit breaker pattern\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/core/config.py` - Added Redis pool size, timeouts, and circuit breaker settings\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Added `RedisLogger` class with comprehensive logging\n  - `backend/app/core/redis.py` - Created new Redis client module (connection pooling, circuit breaker)\n  - `backend/app/core/__init__.py` - Exported Redis components\n  - `backend/app/main.py` - Added Redis initialization/shutdown and health check endpoint\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `CircuitBreaker` class with CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN states for fault tolerance\n  - `RedisManager` class with connection pooling via redis-py `ConnectionPool`\n  - SSL/TLS support via `rediss://` URL detection (Railway uses SSL)\n  - Connection retry logic with exponential backoff for cold starts\n  - Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable (all methods return None)\n  - Comprehensive logging: connection errors (masked URL), timeouts, circuit state changes\n  - Health check endpoint at `/health/redis` with circuit breaker state\n  - Convenience methods: get, set, delete, exists, expire, ttl, incr, decr, hash ops, list ops\n- **Verified requirements:**\n  - Log all outbound API calls with endpoint, method, timing ✓\n  -

Connect via REDIS_URL environment variable ✓\n  - Handle Redis connection failures gracefully (cache is optional) ✓\n  - Use SSL/TLS for Redis connections in production ✓\n  - Implement connection retry logic for cold starts ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - redis-py's `ConnectionPool.from_url()` auto-detects SSL from `rediss://` scheme\n  - Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures: track failures → open circuit → wait recovery_timeout → half-open test → close on success\n  - Use `asyncio.Lock()` to protect circuit breaker state changes in async context\n  - Railway sets `REDIS_URL` with `rediss://` prefix for TLS connections\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.6\n- Created pytest configuration with fixtures for database and Redis mocking\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/tests/__init__.py` - Test package marker\n  - `backend/tests/conftest.py` - Pytest fixtures for testing\n  - `backend/tests/test_fixtures.py` - Sample tests verifying fixtures work\n- **What was implemented:**\n  -

`async_client` - Async httpx AsyncClient for async endpoint tests\n  - `mock_logger` - For testing log output\n  - `freeze_time` - Utility for freezing time in tests\n- **Already existed (verified):**\n  - pytest configuration in `pyproject.toml` with asyncio_mode=\"auto\"\n  - Dev dependencies including pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, aiosqlite\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `StaticPool` for SQLite to ensure same connection is reused in session scope\n  - aiosqlite requires `check_same_thread=False` in connect_args\n  - MockRedis must implement both bytes return values (like real Redis) and clear() for test isolation\n  - Use `ASGITransport` with httpx `AsyncClient` for async testing FastAPI\n  - Fixtures that mock global singletons must store/restore original state\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.7\n- Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline with lint, test, and type-check jobs\n- Files created:\n  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions CI workflow\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/pyproject.toml` - Added ruff and mypy to dev dependencies, configured both tools\n  - `backend/app/core/logging.py` - Added explicit type annotation for formatter variable\n  - `backend/app/core/redis.py` - Fixed type annotations for dict/list return types, added AsyncGenerator import\n  - `backend/app/core/database.py` -

Log mock/stub invocations for debugging (DEBUG level) ✓\n  - Tests work with DATABASE_URL env var ✓\n  - Use test database, not production ✓\n  - CI mirrors Railway environment (Python 3.11, env vars) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - MyPy `ignore_missing_imports = true` doesn't prevent \"cannot subclass Any\" errors - use `disallow_subclassing_any = false` for specific modules\n  - Ruff's `--output-format=github` produces GitHub-compatible annotations for inline error display\n  - pydantic-settings and pythonjsonlogger need explicit module entries (not just `.*` patterns) in mypy overrides\n  - Use `ruff check --fix` for auto-fixable issues, then manually address remaining warnings\n  - CI jobs run in parallel by default - use `needs:` to create dependencies between jobs\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.8\n- Configured Railway deployment for staging environment\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/railway.toml` - Railway configuration with health check, nixpacks builder, and staging env vars\n  - `backend/app/deploy.py` - Deployment script with comprehensive logging (runs migrations, validates env, health checks)\n  -

`phase_status` JSONB field with default empty object `'{}'::jsonb` for flexible phase tracking\n  - Indexed columns: name, client_id, status for efficient queries\n  - Timestamps: created_at and updated_at with server defaults\n  - Migration creates table with proper PostgreSQL types (UUID, JSONB, TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Use `UUID(as_uuid=False)` to store UUIDs as strings in SQLAlchemy, avoiding UUID object serialization issues\n  - JSONB `server_default` requires `text(\"'{}'::jsonb\")` syntax, not just `text(\"{}\")`\n  - `mapped_column` with `default=dict` provides Python-side default, `server_default` provides database-side\n  - Alembic migrations should use modern Python type annotations (`str | None` vs `Union[str, None]`)\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.10\n- Created CrawledPage model with normalized_url, category, labels JSONB fields\n- Files created:\n  -

Individual indexes on project_id, normalized_url, category for queries\n- **Learnings:**\n  - For JSONB arrays, use `default=list` for Python-side and `server_default=text(\"'[]'::jsonb\")` for database-side\n  - Use `sa.ForeignKeyConstraint` in migrations for foreign keys with named constraints and `ondelete` behavior\n  - Composite unique indexes prevent duplicate URLs within the same project while allowing same URL across projects\n---\n\n## 2026-01-31 -

Python's `fnmatch` uses shell-style globbing where `*` matches ANY characters including `/`, unlike pathlib's glob\n  - pytest fixtures with `@pytest.fixture` decorator cause mypy \"untyped decorator\" warnings in strict mode - this is expected behavior\n  - Tests should be organized by feature area: URL normalization, pattern matching, validation, exceptions\n  - URLNormalizationOptions provides fine-grained control: `strip_www`, `allowed_query_params`, `blocked_query_params`\n  - PatternMatcher checks exclude patterns first (precedence), then include patterns\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.33\n- Implemented URL pattern rules for categorizing crawled pages into semantic categories\n- Files created:\n  -

WARNING-level logging for validation errors and not-found cases\n  - Proper error codes: VALIDATION_ERROR, NOT_FOUND, INTERNAL_ERROR\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log all incoming requests with method, path, request_id (via middleware in main.py) ✓\n  - Log request body at DEBUG level (sanitize sensitive fields) ✓\n  - Log response status and timing for every request ✓\n  - Return structured error responses: {\"error\": str, \"code\": str, \"request_id\": str} ✓\n  - Log 4xx errors at WARNING, 5xx at ERROR ✓\n  - Include request_id in all responses for debugging ✓\n- **Railway deployment requirements met:**\n  - CORS via FRONTEND_URL env var (existing config) ✓\n  - Proper error responses with request_id ✓\n  - Background task execution for bulk categorization ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Pydantic field name `schema_json` conflicts with a BaseModel method - use `json_ld_schema` instead\n  - Use `BackgroundTasks` for async bulk operations like `categorize/all` (returns 202 Accepted)\n  - Import ContentAnalysis from utils for proper type annotations in response conversion\n  - Nested router prefix pattern extracts project_id from path: `prefix=\"/projects/{project_id}/phases/categorize\"`\n  - Pydantic `ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)` enables direct SQLAlchemy model validation\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.39\n- Created comprehensive unit tests for pattern matching and confidence scoring in CategoryService\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/tests/services/test_category_service.py` - 58 unit tests for CategoryService\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - CategorizationRequest dataclass tests (2 tests)\n  - CategorizationResult dataclass tests (5 tests) including to_dict and content_analysis conversion\n  - CategoryService initialization tests (3 tests) for default values, custom threshold, LLM fallback settings\n  - URL validation tests (7 tests) for valid/invalid URLs, schemes, and categories\n  - URL confidence scoring tests (5 tests) verifying base confidence logic (0.6 for pattern match, 0.3 for other)\n  - Content signal boosting tests (5 tests) verifying signals boost confidence, schema signals, multiple signals stacking\n  - LLM fallback threshold tests (4 tests) for is_high_confidence, skip_llm behavior\n  - URL-only categorization tests (6 tests) for synchronous categorize_url_only method\n  - Categorize request tests (2 tests) using CategorizationRequest objects\n  - Batch categorization tests (4 tests) for categorize_many with project_id propagation\n  - Error handling tests (2 tests) for validation errors\n  - Exception classes tests (4 tests) for exception hierarchy\n  - Singleton and convenience function tests (2 tests)\n  - Timing and tier assignment tests (4 tests)\n  - Valid categories property tests (3 tests)\n- **Coverage achieved:**\n  - CategoryService: 72% coverage (uncovered lines are mainly LLM fallback code paths)\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Test failures include full assertion context (pytest default) ✓\n  - Log test setup/teardown at DEBUG level (pytest-asyncio handles) ✓\n  - Capture and display logs from failed tests (pytest default) ✓\n  - Include timing information in test reports (pytest default) ✓\n  - Log mock/stub invocations for debugging (MagicMock used) ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - CategoryService has three confidence tiers: 0.3 for 'other', 0.5 for non-pattern match, 0.6 for pattern match\n  - Content signals stack additively but cap at 0.95 (max_boost)\n  - LLM fallback threshold of 0.6 determines when Claude is called\n  - Use `skip_llm=True` in tests to avoid needing to mock the Claude client\n  - Batch categorization preserves per-request project_id if already set\n  - CategoryValidationError includes field, value, and message for detailed error context\n  - Test coverage for LLM paths would require mocking ClaudeClient.available and response\n---\n\n## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.40\n- Implemented LabelService for generating 2-5 thematic labels per collection\n- Files created:\n  - `backend/app/services/label.py` - Full LabelService with two-tier labeling approach\n- Files changed:\n  - `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Exported LabelService and related classes\n- **What was implemented:**\n  - `LabelService` class with two-tier labeling approach (patterns + LLM fallback)\n  - `LabelRequest` and `LabelResult` dataclasses for typed operations\n  - Custom exceptions: `LabelServiceError`, `LabelValidationError`, `LabelGenerationError`\n  - Pattern-based labeling from categories, URLs, and title keywords\n  - LLM-based labeling via Claude when pattern confidence is below threshold\n  - Label validation and normalization (2-50 chars, kebab-case)\n  - Configurable `llm_fallback_threshold` (default 0.5)\n  - `generate_labels()` for async labeling, `generate_labels_sync()` for pattern-only sync\n  - `get_label_service()` singleton accessor\n  - `generate_collection_labels()` convenience function\n- **Error logging requirements met:**\n  - Log method entry/exit at DEBUG level with parameters (sanitized) ✓\n  - Log all exceptions with full stack trace and context via `exc_info=True` ✓\n  - Include entity IDs (project_id, page_id) in all service logs ✓\n  - Log validation failures with field names and rejected values at WARNING level ✓\n  - Log state transitions (tier changes) at INFO level ✓\n  - Add timing logs for operations >1 second via `SLOW_OPERATION_THRESHOLD_MS` ✓\n- **Learnings:**\n  - LabelService follows same two-tier pattern as CategoryService (pattern → LLM fallback)\n  - Label normalization: lowercase, hyphen-separated, alphanumeric only\n  - Use Counter for scoring labels from multiple sources (categories, URLs, titles)\n  - Category-based labels get highest weight (3), URL patterns medium (2), title keywords lowest (1)\n  - MIN_LABELS=2 and MAX_LABELS=5 enforced with fallback to generic labels\n  - When checking `result.text` from ClaudeClient, must handle None case explicitly for type safety\n---\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":1281,"oldLines":3,"newStart":1281,"newLines":36,"lines":["   -
