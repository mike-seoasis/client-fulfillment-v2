# Ralph Progress Log

This file tracks progress across iterations. Agents update this file
after each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.

## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)

### Phase Endpoint Pattern
Phase endpoints follow a consistent structure in `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/`:
- Router registered with prefix `/projects/{project_id}/phases/{phase_name}`
- Helper `_get_request_id(request)` to extract request ID from state
- Helper `_verify_project_exists()` returning `JSONResponse | None` for 404 handling
- Structured error responses: `{"error": str, "code": str, "request_id": str}`
- Log levels: DEBUG for request body, INFO for completion, WARNING for 4xx, ERROR for 5xx
- All endpoints include `request_id`, `project_id` in log `extra` dict

### Request Logging Pattern
- Request ID generated by `RequestLoggingMiddleware` in `main.py`
- Available via `request.state.request_id`
- Always include in error responses and log extra data
- Timing tracked with `time.monotonic()` for duration_ms

## 2026-02-01 - client-onboarding-v2-c3y.62
- **What was implemented**: Verified PAA enrichment endpoints already fully implemented
- **Files present** (no changes needed):
  - `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/paa_enrichment.py` - Full endpoint implementation
  - `backend/app/schemas/paa_enrichment.py` - Pydantic request/response schemas
  - `backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` - Router registration at `/projects/{project_id}/phases/paa_enrichment`
  - `backend/app/services/paa_enrichment.py` - Service layer for PAA operations
- **Endpoints available**:
  - `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/phases/paa_enrichment/enrich` - Single keyword enrichment
  - `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/phases/paa_enrichment/batch` - Batch enrichment
  - `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/phases/paa_enrichment/stats` - Statistics
- **Quality checks**: Passed mypy typecheck and ruff lint
- **Learnings:**
  - Pattern: Phase endpoints already well-established, can reference brand_config.py or schedule.py as templates
  - Gotcha: mypy errors in other files (projects.py, logging.py, redis.py) are pre-existing - PAA files are clean
