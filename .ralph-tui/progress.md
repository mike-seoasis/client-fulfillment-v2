# Ralph Progress Log

This file tracks progress across iterations. Agents update this file
after each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.

## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)

- **Model file pattern**: UUID(as_uuid=False) with `str` Mapped type, `text("gen_random_uuid()")` server_default, `lambda: str(uuid4())` Python default. DateTime(timezone=True) with `text("now()")` server_default. Boolean with `text("false")` server_default.
- **Model registration**: Add import to `backend/app/models/__init__.py` and include in `__all__` list (alphabetically sorted).
- **Relationships with back_populates**: Always define both sides. Use `TYPE_CHECKING` guard for imports to avoid circular deps. Parent side uses `cascade="all, delete-orphan"` with list type. Child FK uses `ondelete="CASCADE"` or `ondelete="SET NULL"` as appropriate.
- **Python env**: Use `.venv/bin/python` (not bare `python`) for running tools in backend.

## 2026-02-08 - S8-001
- Created `backend/app/models/keyword_cluster.py` with `KeywordCluster` and `ClusterPage` models
- Added `clusters` relationship to `backend/app/models/project.py` (back_populates with KeywordCluster)
- Updated `backend/app/models/__init__.py` to export both new models
- **Files changed:**
  - `backend/app/models/keyword_cluster.py` (new)
  - `backend/app/models/project.py` (added relationship + imports)
  - `backend/app/models/__init__.py` (added exports)
- **Learnings:**
  - Project model had no existing relationships - this is the first relationship added to it
  - Project model didn't import `relationship` from sqlalchemy.orm - needed to add it along with TYPE_CHECKING guard
  - ClusterPage FK to crawled_pages uses `ondelete="SET NULL"` since deleting a crawled page shouldn't cascade-delete cluster pages
  - All quality checks (mypy, ruff) pass clean
