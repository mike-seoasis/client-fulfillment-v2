## Executive Summary

Great sales copy does one thing: **makes the reader feel something, then gives them a reason to act.**

People don't buy with logic. They buy because they feel something, then justify it with logic afterward. Your copy must tap into emotion first, then provide the rational justification.

This playbook covers the complete process for writing conversion-focused copy that sounds authentically human and avoids the telltale signs of AI-generated content.

**The Copy Equation:**
```
Conversion = (Emotional Trigger × Relevance × Clarity) - Friction
```

## Part 1: Core Copywriting Principles

### The 5 Laws of Sales Copy

#### 1. Benefits Over Features (Always)
Features describe what a product IS. Benefits describe what a product DOES FOR THE CUSTOMER.

| Feature (Weak) | Benefit (Strong) |
|----------------|------------------|
| "Made from 100% polyester" | "Stays vibrant through 100+ washes" |
| "24/7 customer support" | "Get help whenever you need it, day or night" |
| "5000mAh battery" | "Lasts all day on a single charge" |
| "Free shipping" | "Arrives at your door without spending an extra dime" |

**The "So What?" Test**: After writing any feature, ask "So what?" The answer is your benefit.

#### 2. Specificity Sells
Vague claims are forgettable. Specific details are believable.

| Vague (Weak) | Specific (Strong) |
|--------------|-------------------|
| "High quality materials" | "Double-stitched seams with 600D nylon" |
| "Fast shipping" | "Ships same-day, arrives in 2-3 business days" |
| "Many satisfied customers" | "Trusted by 47,000+ customers since 2018" |
| "Great value" | "40% less than department store prices" |

#### 3. One Idea Per Sentence
Each sentence should make exactly one point. If you need a comma, you might need two sentences.

**Cluttered**: "Our flags are made from premium materials that resist fading and tearing, plus they come with a satisfaction guarantee and free shipping on all orders."

**Clean**: "Our flags resist fading and tearing. Every order ships free. And if you're not satisfied, we'll make it right."

#### 4. Write Like You Talk
Read your copy aloud. If you stumble or it sounds stiff, rewrite it.

**Stiff**: "Customers who purchase our products report high levels of satisfaction with their buying experience."

**Natural**: "People love what they buy from us. And they keep coming back."

#### 5. Every Word Earns Its Place
If a word doesn't add meaning, cut it. Ruthlessly.

**Before**: "In order to ensure that you are able to receive the very best possible results..."

**After**: "To get the best results..."

## Part 2: Proven Copywriting Frameworks

### AIDA: Attention → Interest → Desire → Action

The oldest and most reliable sales framework (created 1898, still works today).

| Stage | Purpose | How to Execute |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Attention** | Stop the scroll | Bold claim, surprising stat, or direct address of pain point |
| **Interest** | Keep them reading | Relevant details, "here's what you get" |
| **Desire** | Make them want it | Benefits, social proof, paint the outcome |
| **Action** | Tell them what to do | Clear CTA with urgency if authentic |

**Example (Collection Page)**:
```
[ATTENTION] The flags your neighbors will notice.

[INTEREST] Premium outdoor flags designed to stay vibrant through
sun, rain, and wind. Double-stitched seams. Fade-resistant inks.

[DESIRE] Join 47,000+ customers who fly their colors with pride.
No more replacing faded flags every season.

[ACTION] Shop the collection. Free shipping on orders over $50.
```

### PAS: Problem → Agitate → Solution

Best for copy where the customer has a clear pain point.

| Stage | Purpose | How to Execute |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Problem** | Name their pain | State the problem they're experiencing |
| **Agitate** | Twist the knife | Describe how that problem affects their life |
| **Solution** | Offer relief | Present your product as the answer |

**Example (Collection Page)**:
```
[PROBLEM] Tired of flags that fade after one summer?

[AGITATE] Nothing looks worse than a washed-out flag hanging
limply in your yard. It's embarrassing. And replacing them
every few months gets expensive.

[SOLUTION] Our UV-resistant flags keep their color for years.
Same price as the cheap ones. Ten times the lifespan.
```

### FAB: Features → Advantages → Benefits

Best for quickly explaining product value in limited space (120 words or less).

| Stage | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Feature** | What it is | "Made from 200-denier nylon" |
| **Advantage** | Why that matters | "Stronger than standard polyester flags" |
| **Benefit** | What's in it for them | "Flies proudly for years, not months" |

**Combining Frameworks**: Use AIDA as your overall structure, incorporate FAB to explain features, and weave in PAS when addressing pain points. One case study showed this approach increased conversion from 18% to 42%.

## Part 3: Power Words That Convert

Power words trigger emotional responses and can increase conversion rates by 12.7% or more when used strategically.

### Trust & Credibility Words
Use when building confidence in your product or brand.

```
Proven       Guaranteed    Certified     Backed
Tested       Authentic     Official      Endorsed
Verified     Research      Results       Evidence
Protected    Secure        Safe          Reliable
```

### Urgency & Scarcity Words
Use sparingly and only when TRUE. Fake urgency destroys trust.

```
Now          Limited       Only          Today
Final        Last chance   Ending        Remaining
While supplies last        Don't miss    Act fast
```

### Value & Savings Words
Use when highlighting deals or value proposition.

```
Free         Save          Bonus         Extra
Exclusive    Members-only  Discount      Deal
Value        Reward        Gift          Included
```

### Curiosity & Discovery Words
Use in headlines and opening lines to pull readers in.

```
Secret       Hidden        Discover      Revealed
Inside       Behind        Little-known  Surprising
Unexpected   Finally       Truth         Real
```

### Sensory & Emotional Words
Use to help readers FEEL the product experience.

```
Crisp        Bold          Smooth        Rich
Bright       Vibrant       Soft          Warm
Fresh        Clean         Sharp         Deep
```

### Action Words for CTAs
Use at the end to drive the click/purchase.

```
Shop         Get           Grab          Claim
Start        Try           See           Find
Browse       Explore       Choose        Pick
```

**Warning**: Don't stuff power words. 2-3 per paragraph max. Overuse dilutes impact and triggers spam filters.

---

## Part 4: Structure & Formatting Guidelines

### The Inverted Pyramid
Lead with the most important information. Most visitors don't scroll to the bottom.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   MOST IMPORTANT (Lead)         │  ← 80% of readers see this
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│   Supporting Details            │  ← 50% see this
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│   Additional Context            │  ← 30% see this
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│   Nice-to-Have Info             │  ← 10% see this
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Scanability Rules

Most visitors spend less than 15 seconds on a page. Design for scanners:

- **Headers**: Use descriptive headers that tell the story alone
- **Bullets**: Use for lists of 3+ items
- **Bold**: Use for key phrases (not keywords - that's outdated)
- **Short paragraphs**: 2-4 sentences max
- **White space**: Let the page breathe

### Header Hierarchy

```
H1: Page Title (one per page, includes primary keyword naturally)
├── H2: Main Section (primary topic)
│   ├── H3: Subsection (supporting point)
│   └── H3: Subsection (supporting point)
├── H2: Main Section
│   └── H3: Subsection
└── H2: Call to Action Section
```

### Word Count Guidelines

| Content Type | Ideal Length | Notes |
|--------------|--------------|-------|
| H1/Title | 5-10 words | Clear, benefit-driven |
| Meta description | 150-160 chars | Include CTA |
| Opening hook | 1-2 sentences | Grab attention immediately |
| Body paragraphs | 2-4 sentences | One idea per paragraph |
| Collection description | 300-450 words | Enough for SEO, not overwhelming |
| Product description | 100-300 words | Depends on product complexity |

### Formatting Don'ts

- **NO em dashes (—)**: They look pretentious and AI-generated
- **NO walls of text**: Break it up
- **NO ALL CAPS**: Except very sparingly in CTAs
- **NO multiple exclamation points**: One max, and rarely
- **NO keyword stuffing**: Natural > optimized

---

## Part 5: Sales-Driven Writing Rules

### Rule 1: Address the Reader Directly
Use "you" and "your" liberally. Make it about them, not you.

**Weak**: "Our company offers premium products."
**Strong**: "You get premium quality without the premium price."

### Rule 2: Eliminate Weasel Words
Weasel words weaken your claims. Be direct.

| Weasel Word | Replace With |
|-------------|--------------|
| "Very" | (delete or use a stronger word) |
| "Really" | (delete) |
| "Quite" | (delete) |
| "Somewhat" | (delete or be specific) |
| "Arguably" | (delete - either argue it or don't) |
| "Helps to" | (just say what it does) |
| "Up to 50% off" | "50% off select items" or actual range |

### Rule 3: Use Active Voice
Passive voice is weak and wordy. Active voice is direct and confident.

**Passive**: "Your order will be shipped by our team within 24 hours."
**Active**: "We ship your order within 24 hours."

### Rule 4: Create Authentic Urgency
Fake urgency destroys trust. Real urgency converts.

**Fake (Don't)**: "Buy now before it's too late!"
**Real (Do)**: "Only 12 left in stock" (if true)
**Real (Do)**: "Winter collection ends January 31"
**Real (Do)**: "Order by 2pm for same-day shipping"

### Rule 5: Show, Don't Tell
Don't claim quality. Demonstrate it.

**Telling**: "High-quality construction"
**Showing**: "Double-stitched seams. Reinforced grommets. Built to last."

### Rule 6: Handle Objections Proactively
Anticipate why someone might NOT buy, and address it.

Common objections:
- Price → "Costs less per year than replacing cheap alternatives"
- Quality → "See why 47,000+ customers trust us (4.8★ average)"
- Shipping → "Free shipping. Arrives in 2-3 days."
- Returns → "Don't love it? Full refund, no questions."

### Collection Page Content Structure

**H1** (5-10 words)
- Include primary keyword naturally
- Title Case formatting
- Benefit-driven when possible

**Top Description** (1-2 sentences)
- Hook the reader immediately
- Set expectations for what they'll find
- Can address a pain point or highlight value

**Bottom Description** (300-450 words)

Structure:
1. **H2** with primary keyword (Title Case, max 7 words)
2. **Opening paragraph** (80-100 words): Quality, selection, value props
3. **H3** first selling point (Title Case, max 7 words)
4. **Body paragraph** (80-100 words): Benefits, differentiators
5. **Internal links**: Related collections and priority pages
6. **H3** second selling point (Title Case, max 7 words)

### Internal Linking Best Practices

- Use 3-6 internal links per collection page

- [ ] Includes social proof if available
- [ ] Has clear CTA in closing paragraph
- [ ] Internal links to related collections

---

## Part 7: Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Sound Human, Not Corporate

**Corporate (Bad)**:
"We endeavor to provide our valued customers with the highest quality products and an exceptional shopping experience."

**Human (Good)**:
"We make great stuff and we're easy to buy from. Simple as that."

### The Friend Test
Would you say this to a friend? If not, rewrite it.

### Contractions Are Your Friend
Use them. They're natural. Don't avoid them.

- "We're" not "We are"
- "You'll" not "You will"
- "Don't" not "Do not"
- "It's" not "It is"

### Tone Spectrum

Adjust based on brand and context:

```
Casual ←————————————————————————→ Professional
"Grab yours"          "Shop now"          "Browse collection"
"Crazy good"          "Exceptional"        "Distinguished"
"You'll love it"      "You'll appreciate"  "You'll find value in"
```

Most e-commerce does best in the middle: Professional but approachable.

### Avoid Corporate Buzzwords

These make you sound like a press release:

```
AVOID: synergy, leverage, optimize, utilize, facilitate,
       paradigm, bandwidth, circle back, move the needle,
       best-in-class, world-class, industry-leading,
       value proposition, pain points, low-hanging fruit
```

## Part 8: AI Writing Tropes to Avoid

> **Critical Section**: These patterns immediately signal AI-generated content. Avoid them to maintain authenticity and reader trust.

### The 6 Reddit-Tested Tells That Expose AI Writing

| Tell | Example | Fix |
|------|---------|-----|
| **"And honestly" as filler** | "And honestly, it changed everything" | Just say the thing |
| **"No fluff" followed by fluff** | "No fluff here..." then 3 paragraphs of disclaimers | Align structure with claim |
| **Machine-gunned short sentences** | "You tried. You learned. You grew." | Vary sentence length |
| **"It's not X, it's Y" contrast** | "It's not just a product, it's an experience" | Make direct statements |
| **Over-signposting** | "First... Second... Key takeaway..." | Let paragraphs flow naturally |
| **Engagement bait without payoff** | "Curious what you think?" then nothing | Ask real questions OR make claims |

### Banned Words: The Master List

#### Tier 1: Instant AI Detection (Never Use)

**The "Delve" Family:**
```
Delve, Delving, Dive into, Deep dive, Unpack, Uncover
```

**The "Unlock" Family:**
```
Unlock, Unleash, Harness, Leverage (just say "use"), Tap into
```

**The "Journey" Family:**
```
Embark on a journey, Navigate, Landscape, Realm, At the forefront
```

**The "Power" Family:**
```
Game-changer, Revolutionary, Transformative, Cutting-edge,
Groundbreaking, Unprecedented
```

**The "Important" Family:**
```
Crucial (just say "important"), Essential, Vital, Pivotal, Critical
```

#### Tier 2: High-Risk Words (Max 1 Per Piece)

**Transitional Words AI Overuses:**
```
Indeed, Furthermore, Moreover, However (at sentence start),
Therefore, Additionally, Consequently, Thus, Subsequently,
Accordingly, Notably, Significantly
```

**Descriptive Words AI Loves:**
```
Robust, Seamless, Comprehensive, Streamline, Enhance,
Optimize, Elevate, Curated, Tailored, Bespoke, Nuanced, Intricate
```

#### Tier 3: Phrases to Eliminate Completely

**Opening Phrases (Delete on Sight):**
```
"In today's fast-paced world..."
"In the digital age..."
"It's no secret that..."
"As we all know..."
"In a world where..."
"Welcome to..."
"Let's dive in..."
```

**Filler Phrases (Always Delete):**
```
"It's important to note that..."
"It's worth mentioning that..."
"It goes without saying..."
"Needless to say..."
"At the end of the day..."
"When it comes to..."
"In terms of..."
"Due to the fact that..." (just say "because")
"In order to..." (just say "to")
```

**Closing Phrases (Find Better Endings):**
```
"In conclusion..."
"To summarize..."
"The bottom line is..."
"All in all..."
"Moving forward..."
```

**Hype Phrases (Deflate or Delete):**
```
"Unlock the potential of..."
"Unleash the power of..."
"Take it to the next level..."
"A testament to..."
"Bridge the gap between..."
```

### Structural Patterns to Avoid

#### 1. The Negation/Contrast Structure
**Pattern**: "It's not just X, it's Y"

**Don't**: "It's not just a flag, it's a statement"
**Do**: "This flag makes a statement."

Limit to ONE per piece max, if at all.

#### 2. The Triplet Pattern
**Pattern**: Three parallel items

**Don't**: "Fast. Simple. Powerful."
**Don't**: "We design. We build. We deliver."

One or two is fine. Three in a row screams AI.

#### 3. The Rhetorical Question-Answer
**Pattern**: Question followed by the answer

**Don't**: "The result? More sales than ever."
**Don't**: "The secret? It's simpler than you think."

Just state the point directly.

#### 4. The Numbered List Dependency
**Pattern**: Everything becomes "First... Second... Third..."

Not everything needs to be a list. Use paragraphs. Vary your structure.

### The Find & Replace Pass

Before publishing, search for and replace:

| Search For | Replace With |
|------------|--------------|
| crucial | important (or delete) |
| utilize | use |
| leverage | use |
| in order to | to |
| due to the fact that | because |
| it's important to note that | [delete] |
| at the end of the day | [delete] |
| game-changer | [be specific about what changed] |
| seamless | smooth / easy |
| robust | strong / reliable |
| comprehensive | complete / full |
| cutting-edge | new / modern |

### The "One Bad Apple" Rule

A single AI word won't expose you. But clustering 2-3 red flags in the same paragraph will.

**Safe**: "This approach helps teams work faster."

**Suspicious**: "This cutting-edge approach helps teams seamlessly unlock unprecedented efficiency gains."

The second sentence uses 4 AI red flags. That's what gets caught.
