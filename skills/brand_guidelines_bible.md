## Executive Summary

AI writing tools are only as good as the brand context they receive. Feed them generic prompts, get generic copy. Feed them comprehensive brand guidelines, get copy that sounds like the brand.

This skill bible teaches you how to build brand guideline documents that give AI everything it needs to write authentically on-brand content every time.

**The Brand Context Equation:**
```
Authentic AI Output = (Brand Foundation + Voice Rules + Audience Intel + Examples) × Specificity
```

The more specific your brand guidelines, the less editing you'll do on AI output.

```

### Example: Completed Customer Persona

```markdown
## Customer Persona: "Studio Pro Sarah"

### Demographics
- **Age Range**: 30-45
- **Gender**: Any (slight female majority in this segment)
- **Location**: Urban areas, primarily US and Canada
- **Income Level**: $60,000-$120,000/year

### Psychographics
- **Values**: Artistic integrity, craftsmanship, reputation
- **Aspirations**: Build a respected portfolio, maybe own a studio someday
- **Fears**: Equipment failure mid-session, damaging their reputation with bad work
- **Frustrations**: Cheap equipment that breaks, inconsistent performance, brands that don't understand artists
- **Identity**: Sees themselves as a serious artist, not just someone with a tattoo gun

### Behavioral Insights

- **Research Behavior**: Reads reviews obsessively, asks peers in Facebook groups, watches YouTube demos
- **Decision Factors**: Reliability first, then ergonomics, then price
- **Buying Triggers**: Equipment starting to fail, recommendation from respected peer, good deal on trusted brand
- **Common Objections**: "Is this brand legit?", "Will it last?", "Can I get parts/support easily?"

### Communication Preferences
- **Tone They Respond To**: Knowledgeable but not preachy, respects their expertise

She's skeptical of marketing hype and trusts peer recommendations over brand claims. She'll pay more for reliability because a broken machine mid-session costs her money and reputation.

### Multiple Personas

Most brands have 2-4 distinct customer personas. Document each one. Label which is primary vs. secondary.

```markdown
## Audience Overview

**Primary Persona**: Studio Pro Sarah (65% of customers)
**Secondary Persona**: Ambitious Apprentice Alex (25% of customers)
**Tertiary Persona**: Studio Owner Sam (10% of customers, but highest LTV)
```

### Key Questions to Ask Clients

3. "What's their biggest fear about buying this type of product?"
4. "What finally convinced your last 5 customers to buy?"
5. "What do customers say in reviews? What words do they use?"

## Part 3: Tone of Voice Framework

### The Nielsen Norman Group 4 Dimensions

Every brand voice can be plotted on four spectrums. This creates a precise voice fingerprint.

```
Dimension 1: FORMALITY
Casual ←————————●————————→ Formal
"Hey!"                      "Dear Valued Customer,"

Dimension 2: HUMOR
Funny ←————————●————————→ Serious
"Oops, we goofed"           "We apologize for the error"

Dimension 3: RESPECT
Irreverent ←————————●————————→ Respectful
"The boring competitors"     "Other solutions in the market"

Dimension 4: ENTHUSIASM
Enthusiastic ←————————●————————→ Matter-of-Fact
"We're SO excited!"         "Now available."
```

### Voice Dimensions Template

```markdown
## Brand Voice Dimensions

### Formality Scale: [1-10]
**Position**: [Number] out of 10 (1 = Very Casual, 10 = Very Formal)
**Description**: [How this manifests in actual writing]
**Example**: "[Sample sentence at this formality level]"

### Humor Scale: [1-10]
**Position**: [Number] out of 10 (1 = Very Funny/Playful, 10 = Very Serious)
**Description**: [When and how humor is appropriate]
**Example**: "[Sample sentence showing appropriate humor level]"

### Reverence Scale: [1-10]

```

```markdown
## Brand Voice Dimensions

### Formality Scale: 4 out of 10
**Position**: Casual-leaning but professional
**Description**: We talk like a knowledgeable friend, not a corporate entity. First names, contractions, conversational flow. But we don't use slang or get too loose.
**Example**: "The EK-3 runs smoother than anything else in its price range. Your hand will thank you after a 6-hour session."

### Humor Scale: 6 out of 10
**Position**: Mostly serious with occasional dry wit
**Description**: We're not trying to be funny, but we're not robotic either. Occasional wry observations are fine. No puns, no jokes about the work.
**Example**: "Yes, we tested it ourselves. Many times. Our artists' arms are basically beta testing equipment at this point."

### Reverence Scale: 6 out of 10
**Position**: Respectful but confident
**Description**: We don't trash competitors by name, but we're confident about our strengths. We respect the craft and the artists.
**Example**: "A lot of machines claim precision. We let the line work speak for itself."

### Enthusiasm Scale: 5 out of 10
**Position**: Balanced energy
**Description**: Confident and engaged, but not over-the-top excited. We believe in our products but we don't oversell.
**Example**: "The new cartridge system is ready. Faster changes, less fuss. Available now."

### Voice Summary
Eikon sounds like a knowledgeable colleague who's been in the industry for years. Confident without being arrogant, helpful without being pushy, professional without being stiff. We speak artist-to-artist, not brand-to-consumer.
```

### Voice Characteristics List

Beyond dimensions, define 3-5 voice characteristics with examples:

```markdown
## Voice Characteristics

### We Are:
1. **Knowledgeable**: We know the craft inside and out. We speak with authority earned from experience.
   - DO: "The 3.5mm stroke length gives you versatility across lining and shading"
   - DON'T: "This product is really good for lots of different things!"

2. **Straightforward**: We say what we mean. No fluff, no hype.
   - DO: "Ships in 2-3 days. Free over $150."
   - DON'T: "Experience the joy of fast shipping on your exciting purchase!"

3. **Supportive**: We're here to help artists succeed, not just sell products.
   - DO: "Questions about needle depth? Our team has your back."
   - DON'T: "Contact customer service for any inquiries."

### We Are NOT:
1. **Hype-driven**: We don't use "revolutionary" or "game-changing"
2. **Condescending**: We never explain things artists already know
3. **Impersonal**: We don't sound like a corporate press release
```

## Part 10: Building Guidelines from Existing Content

### When Starting from Scratch vs. Extracting from Existing

If the brand already has content, you can reverse-engineer their voice from existing materials.

### Voice Extraction Process

```markdown
## Voice Extraction Worksheet

### Step 1: Gather Samples
Collect 10-20 pieces of existing content:
- Website copy (home page, about page, product pages)
- Email campaigns
- Social media posts
- Customer communications
- Founder interviews or podcasts

### Step 2: Analyze Formality
Read samples aloud. Note:
- Do they use contractions?
- Is language conversational or formal?
- Are sentences short and punchy or long and complex?

Formality rating: ___/10

### Step 3: Analyze Humor
Look for:
- Jokes or puns
- Playful language
- Serious tone throughout

Humor rating: ___/10

### Step 4: Analyze Reverence
Look for:
- How they talk about competitors
- How they talk about the industry
- How they talk about customers

Reverence rating: ___/10

### Step 5: Analyze Enthusiasm
Look for:
- Exclamation points
- Superlatives
- Energy level

Enthusiasm rating: ___/10

### Step 6: Identify Patterns
Note recurring:
- Phrases they repeat
- Words they favor
- Sentence structures they use
- Things they never say

### Step 7: Identify Inconsistencies
Where does the voice feel inconsistent?
These are areas to clarify in the guidelines.
```

### Interview Questions for Voice Discovery

When talking to founders, marketing leads, or stakeholders:

1. "If your brand was a person, who would they be? A celebrity, a character, a type of person?"
2. "What's a brand (in any industry) whose voice you admire?"
3. "What's a brand whose voice you definitely don't want to sound like?"
4. "When customers describe you to friends, what words do they use?"
5. "What's something about your brand that surprises people?"
6. "What's a common misconception about your brand or industry?"
7. "Read this sentence aloud - does it sound like something you'd say?" (test samples)

### Red Flags in Existing Content

When extracting voice from existing content, watch for:

- **Inconsistency**: Different pages sound like different brands
- **Generic language**: Could apply to any competitor
- **AI tells**: Signs previous content was AI-generated without guidelines
- **Outdated positioning**: Company has evolved but content hasn't

These indicate areas where guidelines need to establish clarity, not just document existing practice.

## Part 11: Maintaining & Updating Guidelines

### Living Document Protocol

Brand guidelines should evolve. Build in a review process:

```markdown

- [ ] Have any new banned words emerged?
- [ ] Are proof points up to date (customer count, review stats)?

### Update Triggers
Update guidelines when:
- Major rebrand or positioning shift
- New product line launches
- Target audience expands
- Customer feedback indicates voice issues
- New competitors change landscape

### Version Control
- Major updates: 1.0 → 2.0
