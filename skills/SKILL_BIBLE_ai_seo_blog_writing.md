# SKILL BIBLE: AI-Optimized Blog Writing for LLM Visibility

> **Purpose**: Internal SEOasis playbook for writing blogs that get brands mentioned in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google AI Overviews
> **Sources**: 47 expert videos analyzed from Google Search Central, Nathan Gotch, Surfer Academy, and top SEO practitioners

## Executive Summary

Traditional SEO focused on ranking in Google's blue links. AI SEO (also called GEO - Generative Engine Optimization) focuses on getting your brand **mentioned and recommended** by AI assistants like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google AI Overviews.

The key insight: **AI systems prioritize trust signals over traditional ranking factors.** Brand mentions are 3x more important than backlinks for AI visibility. Recent reviews outweigh higher ratings from years ago. And AI platforms pull from different sources - Reddit, LinkedIn, Wikipedia, Medium - not just top Google results.

This playbook covers the complete process for writing AI-optimized blog content that earns brand mentions and drives revenue.

## Part 3: The AI-Optimized Blog Writing Framework

### Phase 1: Research (60-70% of Total Time)

#### Step 1: Analyze Search Intent
```
1. Type target keyword into Google
2. Study SERPs page by page
3. Use Perplexity: "What is the search intent of [keyword]?"
4. Review top-ranking posts to confirm
```

#### Step 2: Conduct Deep Research
**Use ChatGPT Deep Research with this prompt:**
```
I'm writing an article about [TOPIC] for [AUDIENCE].

Research this topic thoroughly using:
- Scholarly journals and academic sources
- Reddit discussions and community insights
- Quora questions and expert answers
- Top-ranking websites on this topic

Focus on:
- Key statistics and data points
- Expert opinions and quotes
- Common questions people ask
- Controversies or debates in this space
- Practical, actionable advice

Provide a comprehensive research report.
```

#### Step 3: Mine YouTube Content
```
1. Search target keyword on YouTube
2. Use Gemini's "ask" feature to summarize top videos
3. Extract unique insights not found in written content
4. Ask follow-up questions for deeper insights
```

#### Step 4: Process Research Properly
- **Read the entire research report** (don't skip to writing)
- Use NotebookLM to convert to audio for mobile consumption
- Consider expert interviews for cornerstone pieces

### Phase 2: Outline Creation

#### Semantic SEO Structure
```
H1: Article Title (one per page)
├── H2: Main Topic Section
│   ├── H3: Subtopic
│   │   └── H4: Specific point
│   └── H3: Subtopic
├── H2: Main Topic Section
│   └── H3: Subtopic
└── H2: Conclusion/Summary
```

#### Outline Enhancement Sources
- **Surfer SEO**: Study competitor outlines
- **Amazon Books**: Search topic, use "Look Inside" for professional ToC structures
- **Top-ranking articles**: Note organizational patterns

### Phase 3: Writing

#### AI-Optimized Introduction Template
```markdown
[Direct answer to the query in 1-2 sentences]

[Brief context: why this matters / who this is for]

[What this article covers - bullet points]

[Optional: Key takeaway or preview of conclusion]
```

**Do NOT**: Write long, flowery introductions. Address user intent immediately.

#### Content Structure for AI Extraction
```markdown
## [Question-based heading that matches search query]

[Direct answer in first 1-2 sentences - this is what AI extracts]

[Supporting details, examples, data]

[Practical application or next steps]
```

#### Entity Association Best Practices
Every key page should naturally include:
- **Brand name** + **category** + **location** (if applicable)
- Related services/products
- Credentials and expertise signals
- "Same as" connections to known entities

**Example**: "SEOasis is a Vancouver-based ecommerce SEO agency specializing in bottom-of-funnel collection page optimization..."

### Phase 4: AI-Specific Optimizations

#### Structured Data for AI Crawlers
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Article Title",

    }
  },
  "datePublished": "2026-01-17",
  "dateModified": "2026-01-17"
}
```

#### FAQ Schema (Critical for AI)
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [{
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": "Question text here?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Direct answer here."
    }
  }]
}
```

#### Robots.txt Configuration
**Ensure these crawlers are NOT blocked:**
```
User-agent: OAI-SearchBot
Allow: /

User-agent: ChatGPT-User
Allow: /

User-agent: GPTBot
Allow: /

User-agent: anthropic-ai
Allow: /

User-agent: PerplexityBot
Allow: /
```

## Part 4: The "Money Pages" Strategy for AI Mentions

### Why Money Pages Matter for AI

AI assistants mention brands most frequently for **middle and bottom-funnel queries** - when users are making decisions, not just learning.

**Goal**: Build 30+ comprehensive money pages that get cited for commercial queries.

### Types of Money Pages to Create

#### 1. Feature-Specific Pages
One page per product feature with:
- MOFU elements (persuasion): Benefits, comparisons, social proof
- BOFU elements (conversion): Specs, pricing, CTAs

#### 2. Industry/Use Case Pages
Target specific customer segments:
- "[Product] for [Industry]"
- "[Product] for [Use Case]"
- "[Product] for [Company Size]"

#### 3. Solution Pages
Address specific problems:
- "How to [solve problem] with [product]"
- "[Problem] solution for [audience]"

#### 4. Comparison Pages
Capture "vs" and "alternative" queries:
- "[Your Product] vs [Competitor]"
- "[Competitor] Alternatives"
- "Best [Category] Tools Compared"

### Money Page Template

```markdown
# [Benefit-Driven Headline Addressing Specific Pain Point]

[Direct answer: what this page helps with]

## Who This Is For
- [Specific audience segment 1]
- [Specific audience segment 2]

## Who This Isn't For
- [Audience that should look elsewhere]

## The Problem
[Pain point description with empathy]

## The Solution
[How your product/service solves this]

## Key Features
### [Feature 1]
[Benefit-driven description]

### [Feature 2]
[Benefit-driven description]

## How It Works
[Step-by-step process]

## Results You Can Expect
[Specific outcomes with metrics if possible]

## Customer Success Stories
[Case study or testimonial]

## Pricing
[Clear pricing or CTA to learn more]

## FAQ
### [Common question 1]
[Direct answer]

### [Common question 2]
[Direct answer]

## Get Started
[Clear CTA]
```

## Part 5: Testing & Monitoring AI Visibility

### Manual Testing Process

#### Weekly AI Query Testing
Test your target keywords in all platforms:

```
ChatGPT: "[Your keyword]"
Perplexity: "[Your keyword]"
Google AI Mode: "[Your keyword]"
Claude: "[Your keyword]"
```

**Track**:
- Did your brand get mentioned?
- Were you in main citations or "more" citations?
- What context was your brand mentioned in?
- Which competitors were mentioned?

#### Conversational Query Variations
Convert keywords to natural language:

| Traditional Keyword | Conversational Query |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| "best SEO agency" | "I need help finding a good SEO agency for my ecommerce store" |
| "coffee storage container" | "What's the best way to keep coffee beans fresh for longer?" |
| "travel french press" | "I'm going camping and want to make good coffee, what should I bring?" |

### Citation Analysis Process

1. Search target keyword in ChatGPT
2. Click "Sources" at bottom of response
3. Document main citations vs. "more" citations
4. Analyze what those sources have in common
5. Identify content gaps to fill

### Monthly Brand Mention Audit

**Platforms to check**:
- Reddit (search your brand)
- LinkedIn (search your brand)
- Wikipedia (check if mentioned)
- Medium (search your brand)
- Quora (search your brand)

**Document**:
- Sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)
- Context of mentions
- Opportunities for engagement

## Part 8: Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Content Mistakes

1. **Creating top-of-funnel "what is" content** - AI handles this directly; focus on decision-stage content

2. **Generic broad content** - "Best SEO Tools" loses to "Best SEO Tools for Shopify Stores Under $50/month"

3. **Faceless brand content** - Publishing under "Admin" or brand name instead of expert authors

4. **Ignoring freshness** - 86% of ChatGPT citations are current-year content

5. **Skipping the research phase** - Jumping to writing without deep research creates shallow content

### Technical Mistakes

1. **Blocking AI crawlers** - Check robots.txt for GPTBot, OAI-SearchBot, PerplexityBot

2. **No Bing indexing** - ChatGPT relies on Bing; no Bing index = no ChatGPT citations

3. **Missing schema markup** - FAQ and Article schema help AI understand your content

4. **Slow page speed** - AI crawlers have timeouts; slow pages may not get indexed

### Strategic Mistakes

1. **Focusing only on Google** - Different AI platforms cite different sources

2. **Ignoring reviews** - Recent reviews outweigh old high ratings

3. **Not monitoring mentions** - You can't improve what you don't measure

4. **Single-platform strategy** - AI pulls from Reddit, LinkedIn, Wikipedia, Medium - be everywhere your audience is

### The 6 Reddit-Tested Tells That Instantly Expose AI Writing

These patterns have been crowdsourced from thousands of Reddit discussions. When 2-3 appear together, readers immediately suspect AI.

| Tell | Example | Fix |
|------|---------|-----|
| **"And honestly" as filler** | "And honestly, it changed everything" | Say the thing without throat-clearing |
| **"No fluff" followed by fluff** | "No fluff here..." then 3 paragraphs of disclaimers | Align structure with your opening claim |
| **Machine-gunned short sentences** | "You tried. You learned. You grew." | Mix rhythm - vary sentence length |
| **"It's not X, it's Y" contrast framing** | "It's not just a product, it's an experience" | Limit to one per piece max, then support with specifics |
| **Over-signposting** | "First... Second... Key takeaway... In contrast..." | Use subheads for structure; let paragraphs flow naturally |
| **Engagement bait without engagement** | "Curious what you think?" then no follow-up | Ask specific questions OR end with strong claim |

---

### Banned Words: The Master List

---

### Structural Patterns to Avoid

#### 1. The Negation/Contrast Structure
**Pattern**: "It's not just X, it's Y" or "X isn't about Y, it's about Z"

**AI Examples (Don't Write Like This):**
- "It's not just a tool, it's a transformation"
- "We're not just building products, we're creating experiences"
- "This isn't about selling, it's about solving"
- "SEO isn't dead, it's evolving"

**Why AI Does This**: Adds perceived depth without adding substance.

**Fix**: Make direct, affirmative statements. If you must use contrast, limit to ONE per piece and support with specifics.

#### 2. The Triplet Pattern
**Pattern**: Three parallel items, often with em dashes

**AI Examples:**
- "Fast. Simple. Powerful."
- "We innovate. We iterate. We deliver."
- "Strategy—execution—results."

**Fix**: One or two is fine. Three in a row screams AI.

#### 3. The Question-Answer Setup
**Pattern**: Rhetorical question followed by the answer

**AI Examples:**
- "The result? More engagement than ever."
- "The secret? It's simpler than you think."
- "What does this mean for you? Everything."

**Fix**: Just state the point directly.

#### 4. The Numbered List Dependency
**Pattern**: Over-reliance on "First... Second... Third..." or "Here's how..."

**AI Examples:**
- "First, identify your target. Second, craft your message. Third, measure results."
- "Here are 5 ways to..."
- "Let's break it down into 3 steps..."

**Fix**: Vary structure. Use paragraphs. Not everything needs to be a list.

#### 5. The Empty Signpost
**Pattern**: Transitions that don't add meaning

**AI Examples:**
- "Now, let's look at..."
- "Next, we'll explore..."
- "With that in mind..."
- "That said..."
- "Having established that..."

**Fix**: Cut the signpost. Start the next section directly.

### The Humanization Checklist (Run Before Publishing)

#### Find & Replace Pass
Search your document for these and replace or remove:

| Search For | Replace With |
|------------|--------------|
| crucial | important (or delete) |
| utilize | use |
| leverage | use |
| in order to | to |
| due to the fact that | because |
| it's important to note that | [delete] |
| at the end of the day | [delete or rephrase] |
| game-changer | [be specific about what changed] |
| seamless | smooth / easy |
| robust | strong / reliable |
| comprehensive | complete / full |
| cutting-edge | new / modern |

#### Structural Checks
- [ ] No more than ONE "it's not X, it's Y" structure in entire piece
- [ ] No triplet patterns (X. Y. Z.)
- [ ] No "The result?" or "The secret?" rhetorical questions
- [ ] Varied sentence lengths (not all short punchy OR all long complex)
- [ ] Opening doesn't start with "In today's..." or "Welcome to..."
- [ ] Closing doesn't start with "In conclusion..."

#### Voice Checks
- [ ] Read aloud - does it sound like a human talking?
- [ ] Are there contractions? (I'm, you're, don't, isn't)
- [ ] Is there at least one specific example, story, or personal detail?
- [ ] Would you actually say this sentence to a colleague?

### Copy-Paste Prompt for AI Writing Tools

Add this to any AI writing prompt to reduce AI-sounding output:

```
WRITING STYLE REQUIREMENTS:

1. NEVER use these words: delve, unlock, unleash, harness, leverage, crucial,
   seamless, robust, comprehensive, cutting-edge, game-changer, landscape,
   realm, journey, embark, foster, paradigm, synergy, elevate, curated

2. NEVER use these phrases: "In today's fast-paced world", "It's important
   to note", "Let's dive in", "At the end of the day", "In conclusion",
   "It's not just X, it's Y", "The result?", "Unlock the potential"

3. NEVER use triplet patterns (X. Y. Z.) or machine-gun short sentences

4. Use contractions (I'm, you're, don't, isn't)

5. Vary sentence length - mix short and long

6. Be direct - state points without throat-clearing phrases

7. Sound like a knowledgeable friend explaining something, not a corporate
   brochure or motivational poster

8. Include at least one specific example or concrete detail per major point
```

---

### The "One Bad Apple" Rule

**Key Insight**: A single AI word won't expose you. But clustering 2-3 red flags in the same paragraph? That's when readers (and AI detectors) get suspicious.

**Safe**: "This approach helps teams work faster."
**Suspicious**: "This cutting-edge approach helps teams seamlessly unlock unprecedented efficiency gains."

The second sentence uses 4 AI red flags (cutting-edge, seamlessly, unlock, unprecedented). That's what gets caught.
