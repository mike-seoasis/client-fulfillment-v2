# Chapter 09: How to Appear in AI Search Results (The GEO Core)

AI search is reshaping how content is discovered, interpreted, and delivered across nearly every major platform. Whether it’s AI Overviews in Google Search, conversational responses in ChatGPT, or synthesized answers in Perplexity, the question content creators and businesses now face is how to show up in all of these places.

The goal now is to understand how information is being retrieved and rebuilt, and then to write and structure content accordingly.

GEO INCLUSION CHECKLIST: THE OVERLAP WITH TECHNICAL ACCESSIBILITY AND CONTENT RELEVANCE

One of the most important steps toward visibility in AI search is ensuring that your content is both accessible and relevant. AI systems rely on structured, crawlable inputs to understand what your content is about and whether it should be included in summaries or responses.

If your content can’t be found, it won’t be surfaced. This remains true whether the user is typing a query into Google Search or being served an AI-generated summary.

Make sure the following technical elements are in place:

Clean, semantic content: Use proper heading hierarchy (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>) and list elements (<ul>, <ol>) to make content easier to parse. 
Robots.txt is open to search and AI systems: Ensure important content sections aren’t being blocked unintentionally. Blocking AI-specific bots may limit your visibility in future generative applications.
XML and HTML sitemaps: XML sitemaps help search and AI crawlers find all indexable URLs, especially deeper pages. HTML sitemaps provide additional discoverability and internal link value.
Avoid unnecessary files like llms.txt: The industry is experimenting with AI-specific directives, but these are not standard or widely referenced by major systems. Focus instead on conventional best practices that make your site easily crawlable and understandable.

There are also some content-focused recommendations: 

Clear topical focus: Stay centered on a specific theme or answer. Don’t overload pages with too many competing ideas.
Descriptive headings: Help the model understand context by making sure your headers accurately summarize the content below them.
Answer-like formatting: Use bulleted or numbered lists, short paragraphs, and direct answers to common questions to increase the chances of being used in AI-generated summaries.
Citations and signals of authority: Where possible, reference reputable sources, include proprietary data, or quote subject matter experts. Generative systems are more likely to surface content that reads as credible and verifiable.

It’s not all technical tips and tricks, though. The best way to ensure visibility in LLMs is if your content resonates. In a time when the internet is overflowing with content, yours must be scroll-stopping. 

Add the R.E.A.L. tenants to your content strategy:

Resonant content that connects with the audience.
Experiential content that’s interactive and engages users. 
Actionable content that provides clear value.
Leveraged content that’s repurposed and distributed strategically.

Making your content technically accessible, semantically clear, and relevant gives you the best chance of being included in AI-generated answers. The overlap between SEO and GEO is real, and getting the technical foundation right is one of the most concrete steps you can take today.

BEING SPECIFIC AND ADDING EXTRACTABLE DATA POINTS

Generative engines validate, compare, and often cite content in their summaries. In that process, concrete facts, figures, dates, and measurable data points become critical signals. AI systems prioritize information they can verify, extract, and repurpose with minimal ambiguity. So, the more specific your content is, the more likely it is to be selected, synthesized, and surfaced.

What to Focus On:

Include specific statistics and quantifiable facts: AI prefers clear numbers over vague generalizations, like saying “85% of users” instead of “most users.” 
Use full dates, not just years or phrases: Models use timestamps to assess content freshness and context. Writing “as of April 2024” or “between 2021 and 2023” gives the model a clearer picture than “in recent years.”
Present data in extractable formats: Use tables, bullet points, or clearly labeled metrics. For example, “Google’s AI Overviews appeared in 51.4% of U.S. search queries in May 2024.” 
Support claims with links to trusted sources: When referencing numbers or studies, cite original data where possible. This improves your perceived authority and gives the model a traceable source to validate.

Measurable data helps AI systems evaluate whether content can be trusted so they can summarize more confidently, align facts across multiple sources, and identify your content as a reliable contribution to an answer.

STRUCTURED DATA AND META SIGNALS

Generative systems have moved beyond simple keyword matching and rely more heavily on structured signals to interpret and reassemble information. Schema.org markup, meta descriptions, and other structural hints give AI models the clarity they need to understand the meaning, relationships, and utility of your content at the page level and within individual elements.

These signals not only improve discoverability but also enhance your inclusion in generative outputs, such as AI Overviews, AI Mode, ChatGPT, Copilot, or Perplexity.

What to Focus On:

Use Schema markup wherever applicable
Implement structured data types that align with your content. Some of the most impactful for GEO include:
FAQPage for direct question-and-answer formatting
Product and Offer for commerce-related content
Organization and Person for entity disambiguation
HowTo for step-by-step instructions
Review, Event, and Article for timely and opinion-based content
Be comprehensive, not just compliant: It’s not enough to pass validation tools like Rich Results Test. The more fully you define entities, attributes, and relationships, the more context you provide for AI to extract and reuse your content.
Add and maintain accurate meta descriptions: While not a ranking factor, meta descriptions often appear in traditional search snippets and can influence how AI systems summarize or preview your content. Make sure they are concise, descriptive, and aligned with the content’s purpose.
Use clear heading hierarchy and internal structure: Proper use of <h1>, <h2>, and <p> tags helps both search engines and LLMs segment and interpret content. This structural clarity supports chunking, summarization, and entity extraction.
Avoid overuse of generic or irrelevant markup: Don’t tag everything. Misusing structured data (like applying FAQPage markup to a list of internal links) may result in Google ignoring it. Focus on honest, well-aligned markup that reflects actual page content.
Generative AI models disambiguate topics, identify entities, and determine the usefulness of content without reading every word on the page. Structured data makes that process faster, more accurate, and more consistent. It serves as a roadmap for machines, instructing them on the meaning of each section and the relationships between different components.
FORUM AND USER-GENERATED CONTENT (UGC) PRIORITIZATION

For queries involving troubleshooting, product comparisons, lived experiences, or niche use cases, user-generated content (UGC) and forum discussions are often prioritized by AI systems. Generative models value this type of content because it reflects authentic, diverse, and situational insights that can’t always be found in more polished corporate content.

This trend has become more visible with Google’s Hidden Gems update and the increasing appearance of Reddit and Quora excerpts in AI Overviews and conversational results.

What to Focus On:

Understand when UGC is preferred. AI systems tend to surface forum or user discussion content for:
Technical troubleshooting and workarounds
First-hand product feedback
Real-world usage tips
“What’s the best…” or “has anyone tried…” type queries
Encourage structured contributions on your platform. If you manage a site with user input (e.g., reviews, Q&A, forums), prompt contributors to:
Use full sentences
Include specific outcomes or setups (“When I used X on a Mac M1…” rather than “didn’t work”)
Separate multi-part answers with line breaks or bullet points. AI models favor structured language because it’s easier to extract, summarize, and rephrase.
Mark up UGC with clear schema where possible: Use schema.org for Review, QAPage, or DiscussionForumPosting to help search and AI systems identify user responses and rank them appropriately.
Optimize for content utility. For UGC-heavy queries, the rawness of the response can be a strength. AI is trained to detect utility signals like:
Whether the answer solves the user’s problem
If it includes steps or explanations
If others upvoted or replied to it (engagement as a signal of quality)
Monitor how AI surfaces public UGC: AI Overviews and Perplexity frequently quote Reddit threads, YouTube comments, and niche forums. Tracking when and where this happens gives insight into how informal content is influencing generative summaries.

AI engines are increasingly looking beyond corporate blogs and product pages to answer real human questions. For GEO, this means content strategy should account for where and how your audience is sharing insights. 

HIGH-QUALITY, ENTITY-RICH, EMBEDDING-FRIENDLY LANGUAGE

In traditional SEO, content relevance often meant placing the right keywords in the right spots. But in the context of GEO, keyword density matters less than clarity, relevance, and how well your content maps into vector space. 

Generative AI systems work by encoding language into vector representations called embeddings. These embeddings capture the relationships between concepts, not just words. The clearer and more semantically rich your content, the easier it is for AI models to parse, understand, and reuse it.

What to Focus On:

Write with clearly defined entities: Use precise language that identifies the main subject or concept being discussed. For example, instead of “this tool,” say “Google Search Console.” Named entities (like brands, people, products, and places) help language models resolve meaning more effectively.
Use consistent terminology: Pick one term for each concept and use it consistently across your content. LLMs can struggle with synonyms or ambiguous phrases. Repetition of precise terms strengthens the entity embedding.
Include modifiers and descriptors: Qualifiers like size, function, location, and purpose help differentiate similar entities. For instance, “enterprise SEO agency” conveys more meaning than just “agency.”

Clarity fuels visibility in generative systems. Your goal is to write in a way that helps the model make accurate, meaningful associations between topics. This makes your content more retrievable and more useful as part of the AI’s response.

It doesn’t stop there, though. Considerations when creating quality content can go much deeper. 

Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of splitting text into smaller units called ‘tokens’. These tokens can be words, subwords, or even characters. It’s a foundational step in most natural language processing (NLP) tasks, crucial for analyzing text, calculating keyword density, and preparing input for models like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT).

Tokenization can also be used to protect sensitive data or to process large amounts of data. 

Example: 

For the sentence, “Google Search is evolving with AI Overviews.”, tokenization might produce tokens such as [‘Google’, ‘Search’, ‘is’, ‘evolving’, ‘with’, ‘AI’, ‘Overviews’, ‘.’]

Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS Tagging)

Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is the process of marking up a word in a text as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context. This helps AI models understand the grammatical structure and meaning of a sentence.

Example:

In the sentence, “The cat sat on the mat,” POS tagging would identify “cat” as a noun, “sat” as a verb, and “on” as a preposition.

Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into predefined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

Example:

In the sentence, “Apple is headquartered in Cupertino, California,” NER would identify “Apple” as an organization and “Cupertino, California” as a location.

Entity Linking

Entity Linking (EL) is the task of connecting named entities in text with their corresponding entries in a knowledge base (like Wikipedia or Wikidata). This process disambiguates entities and provides a rich context for AI models.

Example:

If a text mentions “Washington,” EL would determine if it refers to George Washington (person), Washington State (location), or Washington D.C. (location).

Semantic Search

Semantic search is a data retrieval process where the search engine attempts to understand the meaning and context of the query, rather than just matching keywords. It uses vector embeddings to find results that are conceptually similar to the query.

Example:

A semantic search for “best place to see the northern lights” would return articles about Norway, Iceland, and Alaska, even if the query didn’t contain those specific country names.
