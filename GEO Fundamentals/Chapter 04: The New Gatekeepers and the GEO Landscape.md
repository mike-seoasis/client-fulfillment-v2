# Chapter 04: The New Gatekeepers and the GEO Landscape

A study by Elon University found that 52% of U.S. adults now use LLMs, 34% of whom use them at least once a day, and that number is sure to grow. Whether you’re using them for work, fun, or handling personal chores and projects, AI systems have woven their way through our daily lives relatively quickly in the past couple of years. 

The major players in the AI world all offer systems with different strengths and weaknesses and achieving visibility in them is what spawned the creation of Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). Understanding them will be the ongoing challenge for marketing professionals. 

GOOGLE (AI OVERVIEWS, AI MODE, GEMINI)

Google remains the dominant force in search, and its move into generative AI has only deepened that. Google searches increased by 20%+ in 2024, with ~373X more searches than ChatGPT. With AI Overviews, AI Mode, and the Gemini model family, Google is reshaping the search experience. 

AI Overviews launched in May 2024, pulling content from across the web and synthesizing it into direct answers at the top of the search results page. What used to be the top position is now an AI-generated summary that users don’t need to click away from or scroll past. These summaries now appear in over 50% of searches. 

AI Mode, which started rolling out to everyone in May 2025, lets users switch their entire search experience into an AI-first interaction where queries are answered conversationally and the generative interface becomes the default surface, not the links below it. 

Gemini powers much of this behind the scenes, fine-tuning Google’s understanding of language, context, and user intent. Google’s CEO has also declared it to be the future of search, poised to eventually become the default search function. 

For brands, this evolution means:

More impressions: Your content may be seen more often because it’s being summarized in the Overviews.
Fewer clicks: But users may never visit your site because they already got what they needed from the summary.

This has been referred to as the Great Decoupling in the SEO industry, first mentioned by X user Darwin Santos. 

From May to July 2025, SimilarWeb data indicate that fewer than 20% of Google search users click a link to an external site, while fewer than 4% do so in AI Mode. This sharp gap in outbound clicks from AI Mode signals the need to completely redefine KPIs for measuring organic search performance.

That makes GEO critical. You’re optimizing to be part of the answer, to be cited (if at all) in an AI-generated summary, and to have your content recognized as trustworthy and authoritative by a generative model.

OPENAI (CHATGPT)

Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT became the first mainstream face of generative AI, showing people that AI can be a collaborative partner and not just a search tool.

ChatGPT handles a wide range of use cases:

General knowledge answers: Like a search engine, but in plain conversation.
Creative generation: Writing, brainstorming, and idea development.
Live web search: ChatGPT can pull real-time information from the web.
Coding: Helps you write and debug your code.

But unlike Google, OpenAI isn’t trying to replicate the search results page. It’s an interactive experience where users can refine their questions and follow up in the same chat.

From a GEO standpoint, OpenAI is a whole new kind of discovery gatekeeper. You’re optimizing for whether ChatGPT can find, understand, and use your content in an answer. And since it can read live web content, your site needs to be:

Clear (easy for an AI to parse)
Authoritative (so it trusts your answers)
Well-structured (using semantic HTML and structured data where possible)

If your content is vague, unstructured, requires JavaScript, or buried behind confusing interfaces, ChatGPT might miss it entirely.

Even though OpenAI isn’t technically a search engine, people ask ChatGPT for product recommendations, learning resources, and how-tos. Some even skip Google entirely and go straight to AI for fast answers. 

While its usage is lower than Google’s, ChatGPT experienced some of the fastest user growth in tech history, gaining its first 100 million users in just two months. Today, ChatGPT has more than 800 million weekly users, with over 3 billion visits per month. With integrations into Microsoft tools, iOS, Android apps, and plugins, it continues to expand and it’s become a key way for people to discover and engage with information.

PERPLEXITY

Perplexity has quickly become one of the most credible players in the answer engine space. While Google and OpenAI dominate because of their massive user bases and product ecosystems, Perplexity stands out for its focus on:

Transparency: Every answer includes clear citations to the original sources.
Real-time information: Answers are built from the latest web content, not outdated training data.
Credible sources: The platform tends to pull from trusted, high-authority sites.

Perplexity even contributed to the inception of the entire GEO industry, when researchers utilized the LLM to explore how to optimize rankings. Today, it boasts 15 million monthly active users. 

For GEO, Perplexity is both an opportunity and a challenge:

Your content can show up in answers without needing to win Google’s top search rankings.
High-quality sources get pulled into Perplexity’s responses, giving smaller sites a shot at visibility.
Perplexity prioritizes clarity, accuracy, and authority.
Thin, poorly structured, or generic content won’t surface.

If your site isn’t crawlable in real-time or lacks trustworthy sourcing, you’ll miss out here.

ANTHROPIC (CLAUDE)

Anthropic’s Claude models are becoming a major force in the generative AI space by focusing on safety, alignment, and trust. From the start, Anthropic designed Claude to follow three core principles:

Helpful
Harmless
Honest

Anthropic hasn’t built a consumer search engine, but Claude powers discovery in a range of conversational products:

Poe: A consumer chatbot platform.
Slack integrations: Helping teams find and summarize information.
Enterprise tools: Where factual accuracy and ethical AI behavior matter most.

Launched in March 2023, Claude quickly grew a multi-million-user base. Today, it has 18.9 million global monthly active users.

Claude’s strength lies in conversational discovery, especially in professional and knowledge-driven environments. In GEO, Claude uses a broad training dataset combined with curated retrieval systems to surface and summarize relevant content. 

However, for a while, it didn’t crawl the live web, which was a negative aspect as it was often pulling from outdated information. 

For brands and publishers, this again means you must optimize content to be:

Factually accurate and consistent
Ethically framed (avoiding manipulative tactics or biased claims)
Easy to synthesize (clear structure, strong sourcing, and neutral tone)

As its RAG capabilities expand, expect Claude to play a growing role in enterprise search, knowledge bases, and customer support.

MICROSOFT (BING'S COPILOT)

Microsoft took a full-stack approach to generative AI, building its Copilot system into products people use every day and not just search.

In search, Bing’s Copilot works a lot like Google’s AI Overviews (though Copilot was first, released in early 2023 while AIOs rolled out in May 2024):

Delivers conversational answers instead of just links
Pulls from web results in real time
Synthesizes clear, cited summaries right on the search page

When it launched, it grew a user base of 18 million active users. Today, it sees around 37 million monthly users. However, Microsoft 365 has over 400 million paid seats, and Windows remains active on over 1.4 billion devices, so by embedding Copilot into Outlook, Word, Excel, and Edge, Microsoft is quietly turning generative search into a native part of everyday productivity.

Through Copilot in Microsoft 365, generative AI powers daily tasks like:

Summarizing long email threads in Outlook
Drafting reports in Word
Analyzing spreadsheets in Excel
Creating slide decks in PowerPoint

From a GEO perspective, Bing’s Copilot is a growing surface for content discovery. Copilot answers frequently cite web sources, meaning your content can appear in Microsoft’s AI-generated summaries.

However, keep in mind that Bing’s overall search market share is still smaller than Google’s. Google has 1 billion daily active users, while Bing has 100 million. In 2025, Google continues to dominate the global market, holding a 89.54% market share compared to Bing’s 3.98%.

For brands, this means your content should be ready for conversational queries, summaries, and task-driven AI interactions happening across the Microsoft ecosystem.

TRADITIONAL SEARCH ENGINES VS. AI SEARCH

Both traditional and AI-driven search aim to help users find information, but how they do it differs.

Traditional Search (like classic Google):

Shows a ranked list of links
Users have to click through, evaluate sources, and piece together answers
Visibility = ranking position (higher rank, more clicks)

AI Search (like Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, or ChatGPT with browsing):

Synthesizes answers from multiple sources directly on the results page
Often reduces or removes the need to visit external sites
Visibility = inclusion in the AI-generated summary (whether or not your link appears)

This change in how answers are delivered has a big impact on strategy.

Traditional SEO prioritized:

Metadata
Keyword targeting
Crawlability and indexation
Page speed and links

GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) focuses on:

Semantic clarity: Clear language and meaning that models can interpret.
Factual accuracy: Reliable, verifiable content that AI trusts.
Machine-readable structure: Schema markup, clean layout, and structured data that support extraction and summarization.

This is a big shift for brands and publishers because a top organic ranking doesn’t guarantee visibility anymore. Well-structured, clear content often wins, even if it’s not from the biggest site. 

Traditional Search

Summary compiled from multiple sources

Requires clicking and researching

No need to click away

Visibility = rank

Visibility = inclusion in AI summary

Prioritizes:

Metadata
Keyword targeting
Crawlability and indexation
Page speed and links

Prioritizes:

Semantic clarity
Factual accuracy
Machine-readable structure
CRAWL-BASED DISCOVERY VS. API-BASED ACCESS

Generative AI models pull information in two ways:

1. Crawl-Based Discovery (Open Web Crawling)

This is the model most content creators are already familiar with, and how traditional search engines like Google and Bing have worked for decades. Crawlers request a page, extract the links, build a queue, and keep doing that until they find the end of the web.

LLMs like ChatGPT and Perplexity don’t “crawl,” they request, and they don’t index content or cache the pages so they are requesting in real time. 

How it works:

AI bots request info from publicly accessible web pages.
Content is used to generate the AI search summaries or responses.
Your site may be included in answers even without you submitting anything directly.

With this method, your content can be discovered and surfaced without additional setup. However, you often have little control over how your content is interpreted, summarized, or cited, and your content may appear in AI outputs without clear attribution.

2. API-Based Access (Licensed or Structured Feeds)

This model gives AI systems structured, direct access to your content via approved APIs or data partnerships. This is used by ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Copilot integrations. 

How it works:

You share content with AI platforms through official integrations.
These feeds are typically structured, curated, and updated regularly.
Access is often restricted, licensed, or paywalled.

With this model, you retain more control over what data is shared, how it’s presented, and how often it’s updated. However, participation is often limited to companies with licensing deals or API infrastructure, and greater control may come at the cost of reduced organic visibility. 

For brands and publishers, your discovery method shapes your visibility and influence in generative systems:

If your content is open to crawling, it’s likely being used, but you may not know how or when.
If you use API-based access, you can shape the narrative, but you need the resources and partnerships to do it.
Knowing how your content is being accessed, and by whom, is a critical step in optimizing for the future of AI-driven discovery.

Each of the major players in AI search brings a different model, interface, and expectation to the way content is discovered. Generative Engine Optimization is still evolving, but one thing is clear: discovery lives across interfaces, in summaries, inside apps, and within conversations. Knowing how each platform works and how your content is accessed gives you the leverage to stay visible in this new layer of the web.
