# Chapter 10: Relevance Engineering in Practice (The GEO Art)

Now that you understand how Relevance Engineering drives content’s ability to rank in AI Search and LLMs and how to engineer content for visibility, let’s discuss the art of Relevance Engineering. Gaining visibility in large language models means moving past traditional keyword mapping and providing content that matches models on a semantic level. Instead of focusing on keyword usage, the goal is to create content that is highly relevant to a user’s query and easy for search engines and LLMs to extract information from. There are a number of factors that go into how search engines view relevancy in order to rank and serve AI-driven results. Let’s take a look at those.

ELEMENTS OF RELEVANCE: SEMANTIC SCORING AND PASSAGE OPTIMIZATION

Search engines have long evolved past the keyword density model. It’s no longer viable to include a specific keyword in content multiple times to signal its relevance for that keyword. Modern algorithms use models like BERT and GPT and no longer just look for keywords. They analyze entire passages to understand meaning or semantic relevance.

What is Semantic Scoring?

Semantic scoring measures the conceptual and contextual relevance of a piece of content and goes beyond simple keyword matching. It assigns a numerical score that indicates how well the meaning of the content aligns with the keyword or topic.

For example, a piece of content on engine repair would include target keywords like “how to fix an engine” or “engine repair” and in the old model would repeat those queries in key areas. In the semantic model, it’s not enough to simply overstate keywords. The most relevant piece of content would use related terms and phrases like “engine leak”, “engine repair cost”, “faulty spark plug”, or “misfire”. This shows a comprehensive understanding of the topic and increases the semantic score.

What is Passage Optimization?

Passage optimization is semantic scoring in action. It’s about structuring content for relevance but also for extractability. AI and retrieval augmented generation operate based on the retrieval of various sets of information to build the whole set of results. It’s pulling passages from a wide set of inputs to directly answer a query.

Optimizing for extractability means that content should be organized into easily defined sections. Headings and subheadings should be clear, and passages should answer queries directly and succinctly. The combination of query/passage is defined as a semantic unit, and these units are used to power AI search.

For example, a recipe landing page has various sections of information, including ingredients, steps, and timing. Each of these sections should be labeled with a clear, query-based heading like “How to cook a steak,” or “What type of steak should I cook”, or “Steak seasonings.” A clear structure and content architecture allows search engines to find the exact passage that answers the search like “ingredients to make a steak.”

Your Content is The Embedding

This combination of machine learning and content strategy creates a new approach to content that transitions from simple keyword insertion to engineering well-structured, semantically rich content that meets both users’ and search engines’ needs.

Semantic scoring and passage optimization are parts of the larger grouping known as embeddings. Embeddings are numerical representations of a word, phrase, or document in a vector space. Content Engineering in practice is about improving those embeddings, therefore increasing the relevance and proximity of words and phrases within that vector space.

Here are a few tactics to improve your content with Relevance Engineering:

7 WAYS TO TUNE VECTORS AND ENHANCE EMBEDDINGS
Topic Clustering Optimization: Websites with clear information architecture allow AI to parse and correlate their topical authority. Strong internal linking between category and pages is key. Strong semantic clusters signal to LLMs that pages are deeply related and highly relevant to the same main topic.
Avoid Keyword Stuffing: Instead of focusing on primary and secondary keywords, focus on natural repetition and synonyms to create well-written content on subject versus having high keyword density.
Embedding Quality: Engineering content to improve its performance in vector space means improving its embedding quality. This includes capturing the relationships between words and concepts by improving a page’s semantic score, optimizing passages into clear, easy-to-retrieve semantic units, and incorporating entities that improve a page’s relevance and connection to a topic.
Content Architecture: The same tenets of good writing still apply here. Write strong, logical and well-reasoned content. Use each paragraph and sentence to build narrative cohesion. Use a wide range of synonyms and long-tail keywords. Provide clear answers to related questions to provide a nuanced piece of content that is more likely to be understood by algorithms.
Implement Structured Data: Schema markups explicitly define the relationships between different entities without a piece of content. For example, FAQPage or HowTo schema communicate the structure and purpose of your content. This can make these connections plain for search engines leading to more accurate embeddings and vector representation.
Strategic Internal Linking: Anchor text still matters and where you link matters even more. To improve the connection between pages and build topical authority, link between article and product pages on a single topic.
Prioritize User Intent: Instead of writing for SEO, write to answer a user’s questions or solve their problem. Include all the different parts of a query and what information they would need to know to have a comprehensive understanding. What questions would they ask and what answers would they need to know? This approach ensures that content is a true representation of the subject and meets audience needs.
CONTENT SIMULATION: WAYS TO TEST YOUR EMBEDDINGS

AI is rapidly evolving and marketers, content marketers, and creators have to think beyond the traditional user and consider how a new audience sees their work. LLMs view your content in ways that humans don’t and it’s powerful to be able to simulate this view to test if your content engineering is effective. Two ways to do this are prompt injection and retrieval simulation.

What is Prompt Injection?

Prompt injection is where a user adds an input crafted to manipulate an LLM to perform an unintended action, foregoing its original instructions. This is primarily a security breach, but it can be a powerful tool for content marketers. By understanding how an LLM can be “injected” with new prompts, you can simulate how your content may be interpreted. This involves creating prompts to test the limits of how your content is understood.

Retrieval Simulation is the Next Step

Retrieval simulation takes prompt injection further. Instead of testing the output, it simulates the entire process of how LLMs find, use, and serve your data. A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system retrieves your content from its knowledge base and then uses that data to parse an answer.

Retrieval simulation involves:

Building a test dataset: Create test queries and the best-matching content that should be retrieved
Simulating the retrieval process: Using a vector database can simulate how an embedding model would search
Review the results: See how accurately the LLM retrieved high-quality passages for each query. Were they the right passages? If not, you need to improve your embeddings.

Retrieval simulation is a powerful tool to help marketers better understand how LLMs see and use their content. It has a variety of applications and can help you proactively identify and fix gaps in your content.

A couple of questions to ask as you simulate content retrieval:

Are my passages optimized correctly for the related query?
How relevant is this content to the subtopic or main topic cluster?
What additional queries should be included to make this comprehensive?
What is the current semantic score and how can we improve it?
Are there relevant and optimized internal links?
RELEVANCE OPTIMIZATION PLAN TEMPLATE (A GEO BLUEPRINT)

The process of Relevance Engineering is no different from the standard auditing, research, and optimization process. The inputs and outputs are simply different. Here is a Relevance Optimization Plan you can implement across your content to better understand its place in AI. This is a starting point and iPullRank can support your team on content auditing, keyword research and content creation for this new AI-powered world.
