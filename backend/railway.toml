# Railway Configuration for Grove Backend
# Production-ready deployment configuration
#
# This configuration works for both staging and production environments.
# Environment-specific settings should be configured in Railway dashboard:
# - ENVIRONMENT: "staging" or "production"
# - LOG_LEVEL: "DEBUG" for staging, "INFO" for production
# - DEBUG: "true" for staging, "false" for production
#
# PostgreSQL and Redis addons set these automatically:
# - DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection string
# - REDIS_URL: Redis connection string
#
# See RAILWAY_ENV.md for complete environment variable documentation.
